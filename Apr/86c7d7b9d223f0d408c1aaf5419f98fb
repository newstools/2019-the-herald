The Herald PORT SUDAN. – South Sudan’s oil minister said on Monday that the country’s oil was flowing smoothly and problems with importing chemicals for drilling, due to a strike at a port in neighbouring Sudan, had been resolved. Landlocked South Sudan’s main oil shipment hub is Port Sudan in neighbouring Sudan. Chemicals due to be imported by South Sudan via the port for oil drilling were stranded late last week after oil workers at the port went on strike. Oil minister Ezekiel Lol said those chemicals would be shipped to South Sudan on Monday. “I can assure the world and the people of South Sudan that South Sudan oil is flowing smoothly without any difficulties,” Lol said during a visit to Sudan to discuss the issue with Sudanese officials. The chemicals had been held up at the port for three days, he said. “The chemicals that are in Port Sudan will be leaving today for South Sudan,” Lol said. South Sudan’s information minister had said on Friday that the country’s oil exports had been disrupted due to strikes and protests in Port Sudan, but Sudan officials said there had been no disruptions to exports. South Sudan, which ships its oil through Sudan via a pipeline to Port Sudan, says its current oil production is 135,000 barrels per day. – Reuters
