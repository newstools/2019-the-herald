The Herald LONDON. – Christian Eriksen’s present meets the Danish midfielder’s past when his former side Ajax travel to Tottenham for the first leg of an unexpected Champions League football semi-final for both sides tonight. The match kicks-off at 9pm. But where Eriksen’s future lies will give a good indication of whether times have truly have changed at Spurs. Ajax arrive in London already in the knowledge that despite reaching a first Champions League semi-final since 1997, they will sell a number of their shining lights this summer and start again. Frenkie de Jong has already sealed a €75 million move to Barcelona for next season, captain Matthis de Ligt is expected to command a similar fee, while Hakim Ziyech, Donny van der Beek, David Neres and Nicolas Tagliafico could also go. Spurs have benefited themselves from the conveyer belt of talent that rolls through the academy at the Dutch giants. As well as Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Davinson Sanchez will come up against their former club in the last four. Tottenham have long since had a similar, if less prolific strategy. Luka Modric and Gareth Bale eventually outgrew Spurs’ status to join Real Madrid, where they went onto win four Champions League titles together. – AFP.
