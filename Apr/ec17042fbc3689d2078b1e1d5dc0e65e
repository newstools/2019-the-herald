The Herald LONDON. – Virgil Van Dijk said it was a great honour to be voted the Professional Footballers Association Player of the Year. With the Dutchman at the heart of defence, Liverpool have kept a Premier League high, 20 clean sheets in 2018-19 and was the big favourite in the build-up to the ceremony. “It’s pretty difficult to put into words,” he said.  I think it’s the highest honour you can get as a player to get voted player of the year by the players you play against every week.  It’s special. I’m very proud and honoured to receive it.” Van Dijk also took time to praise Liverpool defenders Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson who were anded alongside him in the PFA Tem of the Year. “It’s great to get recognition from other players. Defending is as important as attacking, and obviously tonight we have Trent [Alexander-Arnold] and Robbo [Andrew Robertson] here as well. “I try to play my game, read the game as well as I can. I don’t want to get in difficult situations so I let Robbo do the work. “I like playing for Liverpool, I love playing for Liverpool, and I’m proud to wear the shirt.” Raheem Sterling, who took the writers award, was not at the ceremony to collect his award of Young Player of the Year after helping City to a 1-0 win over Burnley earlier in the day. – The Daily Express.
