The Herald LONDON. — Granit Xhaka has dedicated Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Newcastle in the English Premiership football season opener on Sunday to Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac after the pair were forced to miss the game over security concerns. Over the weekend, two men were arrested and charged following a late night incident outside of Ozil’s home, while some reports say that Kolasinac’s wife has returned to Germany with grave reservations about coming back to England. It’s obviously been a difficult time for both players, and Xhaka was keen to acknowledge that following the game at St James’ Park. “We know the story about Sead and Mesut,” he said. “It’s not easy for them or their family. So we tried to do our best and to get the win for them.” Meanwhile, Unai Emery said he wasn’t yet certain if the duo would be available for Saturday’s home game against Burnley. Asked if they would play, the Spaniard said: “I don’t know now. The club is managing that circumstance. — BBC Sport.
