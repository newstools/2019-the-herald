RADIO personality, Napoleon Nyanhi, said the tour of South African radio stations through The Radio Presenter Masterclass programme was educative and empowering, and gave exposure to local presenters who took part in the six-week visit. Speaking after the tour, Nyanhi, who happens to be the managing director for The Radio Masterclass, expressed satisfaction with the tour. He described it as an educative and empowering exposure (EEE) programme. “We got a lot more than we bargained for, since we also got a tour of the SABC studios. “It is very fulfilling to be playing our part in helping talented young people, who aspire to be media personalities,” he said. Nyanhi added: “We learnt a lot, especially from Kaya FM, who took a whole afternoon to make presentations about how their radio station has risen from bankruptcy to winning the Best Commercial Radio station award three years in a row.” Nyanhi said they had plans to extend to television production, digital broadcasting and live productions. He said the major challenge being faced by radio personalities in the country was the increasing number of people pursuing jobs at radio.  “As a former radio personality, one of the biggest challenges in this sector is increasing the number of personalities joining the industry. “It is critical that media houses and their practitioners start to look at ways of expanding into the region and continent to canvass a wider audience.” The team toured Kaya FM, Metro FM, 5FM, Radio 2000, Ukozi FM, Lesedi FM, Jozi FM and SABC TV studios. They also got the opportunity to witness the shooting of scenes for popular soaps Generations and Muvango. This project was launched in November last year at a function attended by top broadcasters where Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Mr Nick Mangwana was the guest of honour.
