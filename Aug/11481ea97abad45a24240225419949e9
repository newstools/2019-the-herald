The Herald NAIROBI. — President Uhuru Kenyatta has expressed his desire to completely phase out the gambling craze in Kenya by outlawing the practice, TUKO.co.ke has learnt. Even as the Kenyan government continues its efforts to tame betting culture in the country, Uhuru is determined to see an end to gambling companies altogether. Uhuru challenged lawmakers to come up with laws which would eliminate gambling in Kenya. He spoke at Christ is the Answer’s (CITAM) 60th anniversary celebrations at the Karen sanctuary on Saturday where he challenged Nairobi Senator Johstone Sakaja and Woman representative Esther Passaris to present him the bill and he would sign it. “We have this thing called gambling in the country and it is terrible. I alone as Uhuru cannot change this trend. Go back to the constitution and change the laws,” he urged. The Kenyan president went on to urge the operating betting companies to adhere to laws despite the possibility of a law which would hurl them out of business. One of Uhuru’s major points of concern was the fact that gambling only seemed to enrich a few individuals at the expense of millions of participants. — TUKO.co.ke
