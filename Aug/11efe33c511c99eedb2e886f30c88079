The Herald CINCINNATI. — Rafael Nadal withdrew from the Cincinnati Masters tennis tournament for the second year in a row after polishing off his US Open preparation with a Montreal title on Sunday. The announcement came a few hours after Nadal won his fifth Canadian title 6-3, 6-0 over Russian Daniil Medvedev. The oft-injured Spaniard decided against playing any more before the August 26 start of the US Open in new York. “I am very sorry to announce that I won’t be playing in Cincinnati this year,” Nadal posted on Facebook. “No other reason than personally taking care of my body and trying to keep as healthy as I feel now.” Nadal said he explained his position to Brazilian Cincinnati tournament director Andre Silva, whom he said understood. “I’m sure the tournament will be a success and I wish him and his team all the best,” Nadal said. Nadal will go into the US Open with just one hard court warm-up, albeit his record-extending 35th Masters 1000 title. His late withdrawal leaves the Cincinnati draw severely lopsided, with top seed Novak Djokovic and number three Roger Federer positioned in the top half. — AFP.
