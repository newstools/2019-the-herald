Award-winning Gospel musician Hannah Mapeta released her comeback single titled “Muporofita Moses” after a short break from the industry. The song, which has been receiving favourable airplay on local radio stations which include Power FM and Capitalk FM was produced by pastor Eloi Manjoro and recorded at E-MAN-G . “Muporofita Moses is my comeback song which narrates how we should never give up on God no matter how difficult our situation might be. “We should be like Prophet Moses in the wilderness. With the Israelites he had trust in God despite all the tribulations he faced,” she said. The “Mwari anoshanda Nemashoko ako” hit-maker said the song was sung in three languages — Shona, French and English — to popularise the song. She is working on a music video to released soon. “l have always sung in many languages so as to reach out as far as l can to people of different nationalities and as a teacher l teach French,” she said. “l am working on doing a re-brand of all my musical videos. l shall go all out on Muporofita Moses’ music video as well, God willing.” The gospel diva said she had taken a break a few months ago due to some family commitments. “I had to take time out of the music industry because a lot was happening in my life,” she said. “All this required time.”
