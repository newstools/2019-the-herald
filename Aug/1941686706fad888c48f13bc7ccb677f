PROMISING young female motocross rider Tadiwanashe Nyamupfukudza says her target is to prove that girls can also succeed in male-dominated sport. She will represent the country for the first time in the FIM Africa Motocross of African Nations Championships at Donnybrook Park in Harare later this month. The two-day event is slated for August 31 and September 1 at Donnybrook, and will see the top riders from seven African countries — Botswana, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Morocco and Zimbabwe — competing for top honours in all the classes from the PeeWees to the main MX1 Class. And 12-year-old female rider Nyamupfukudza is among the 56 riders that make Team Zimbabwe and is ready to challenge for silverware at one of Africa’s biggest motocross events. “I am honoured to be part of the team that will represent the country. I couldn’t believe it when I heard that I’m part of Team Zimbabwe for this year’s FIM Africa Motocross of African Nations Championships. “My main target is to prove that girls can make it in any given sport, especially the male-dominated sports like motorbike riding. “I’m happy that my friends and classmates at Admiral Tait Primary School now appreciate and understand that it is possible for a female to participate in any given sport as long as one has the passion to do so. “I have been training well and I’m going to intensify my preparations for the event when we close for the school holidays next week.’’
