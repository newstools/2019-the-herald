TEAM Zimbabwe’s athletics coach Lisimati Phakamile yesterday said the level of competition at the African Games has proved to be a tough task after most of the athletes struggled to make an impression in Morocco. The curtain comes down on the continental multi-sport event today. Zimbabwe had athletes in 12 sport codes and picked some medals in swimming, chess and triathlon. Athletics, which provided the largest number of athletes in Team Zimbabwe, found the going tough, with most athletes failing to make the finals in their events. In the men’s 200m event, Ngoni Makusha pulled through to the semi-finals, but could not progress to the final when he came sixth in 21.08seconds in heat two. Tatenda Tsumba also reached the semi-final, but was disqualified in heat three for a false start.
