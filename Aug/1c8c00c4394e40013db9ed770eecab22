The Herald NEW YORK. — Serena Williams overwhelmed Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-1 on Monday to reach the second round of the US Open tennis tournament in search of her 24th Grand Slam title while “rusty” Roger Federer rallied past Indian qualifier Sumit Nagal. Six-time US Open champion Williams crushed the five-time major winner from Russia in only 59 minutes, beating Sharapova for the 19th consecutive time and improving to 20-2 in their all-time rivalry. “Whenever I play her I bring out some of my best tennis,” Williams said. “When you play her you have to be super focused.” Williams, who next plays 121st-ranked US wildcard Caty McNally, blasted five aces and 16 winners while Sharapova made 20 unforced errors. “She served really well. Found her spots really well,” Sharapova said. “I think that’s where she hurt me a lot.” Williams is hoping to match the all-time record of 24 Slam singles titles won by Margaret Court. Swiss third seed Federer, who has a men’s record 20 Slam titles, dropped the opening set in 36 minutes, then returned to form and defeated Nagal 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. “I played like my beard today. I was rusty,” Federer said. — AFP.
