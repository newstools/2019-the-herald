PETER “The Sniper” Pambeni is on the verge of penning a piece of boxing history for Zimbabwe when he fights Namibia’s Albinus ‘’Danny Boy’’ Felesianu for the vacant World Boxing Organisation (WBO) Africa lightweight crown. The 12-round encounter is the main drawcard of six other supporting bouts pencilled in for The Ramatex, Windhoek, tonight. The tournament is being hosted by Salute boxing stable, with giant fixed network operator, MTC, bankrolling it from a multi-million-dollar CSR sponsorship package to the club. Fellow Namibians Natty Kakololo faces Toto Helebe in an African Boxing Union (ABU) featherweight contest while another top of the drawer match will be between Lazarus Shaningwa and David Shinuna for the Namibia national featherweight belt. Currently, the most exciting pugilist on the domestic scene, the Epworth-based Pambeni earned the moniker “Sniper” from his signature jab which he executes with precision. Having spiked his gloves after an unceremonious loss in a WBA-Africa tie against Bongani Mahlangu 11 years ago, Pambeni dusted his boxing boots to come in as an 11th hour replacement for Zambian Semmy Ngoma’s opponent. Since then he has 11 victories, two draws and no loss. The Mau Mau boxing prodigy on Tuesday arrived in Windhoek to be welcomed by placard-waving models. Pambeni’s manager, Stalin Mau Mau, yesterday said his camp would not be reading much into Namibia being a “boxing country’”that has produced numerous world champions of the likes of Harry “The Terminator” Simon, Paulus “The Hitman” Moses and Paulus “The Rock” Ambuunda.
