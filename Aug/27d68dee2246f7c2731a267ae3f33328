The Herald NEW YORK. — Top-ranked defending champion Novak Djokovic takes inspiration from talk he could pass Roger Federer for the all-time record total of men’s Grand Slam singles titles. The 32-year-old Serbian tennis star sees, however, all the work yet to come before that happens, even as he prepares to chase another crown at the US Open starting today in New York. “I’m aware of it, of course. I mean, I’m part of this world. Of course I can’t completely switch off and eliminate what people are talking about. And it’s flattering, obviously,” Djokovic said. “But at the same time, it’s still a very long way ahead of me. It does also put a certain level of responsibility to me as well, because I’m aiming to do that. You know, it’s definitely one of my ambitions and goals. “Things are a little bit different than they were ten years ago, but I still feel young inside and outside. And I still am very motivated to keep going . . . especially now, more or less everything is about Grand Slams.” — AFP.
