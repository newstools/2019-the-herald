BN Academy director Bhekimpilo Nyoni says they are pleased with the way their players fared during their one-week development camp at Football CV Academy in Stamford, United Kingdom. Nyoni together with six of his BN Academy players returned home last Monday and said he was happy with the way the players conducted themselves during the camp with two of them outstanding. The six players — Nigel Mutsonziwa, Ryan Aliam, Rudzo Chiwara, Raymond Kaukonde, Tadiwanashe Benyu and Mathew Nziwi — left the country on August 10 and underwent through drills under the guidance of international coaches and joined several other youngsters drawn from across the world. The camp targeted players between the age of 16 and 18 and it also saw them getting a pep talk from former Nigeria international Sunday Oliseh. “As a development camp, it was meant to encourage the young players to understand the culture of turning professional and they got that from Oliseh who had a presentation last Wednesday. “There were scouts from top teams, which created opportunities for the boys who also worked with international coaches,” said Nyoni. The development comes after BN Academy signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UK-based Football CV Academy in 2016 and this was their third time attending the training camp. From the association, the academy has so far managed to secure a scholarship for one of their boys Carl Hlongwane who is now with Football CV Academy.
