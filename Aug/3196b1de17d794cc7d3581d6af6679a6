NOMADIC gospel musician, Brighton Parwaringira has returned to launch his third 10-track album “Mwari Mubatsiri” after spending many years touring countries in Southern and Central Africa. Parwaringira will also be recording a live DVD album for the same project with an array of local gospel artistes lined up to perform at the event scheduled for The Venue in Avondale, Harare. The 36-year-old musician told The Herald Arts that he decided to return to the country to share the word of God with his own people. “We have been touring a lot of countries preaching the word of God along with Evangelist Christopher Alam from the Dynamis World Ministries. We have been doing crusades in South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana and the Democratic Republic of Congo. “This time around, I decided to return to my country to share the word of God, hence, the launch of this album,” he said. Parwaringira recorded his first album “Huya Kwauri” in 2005 and “Crusade Music”, which was recorded in Portuguese sometime in 2017. “What is interesting about this album— Mwari Mubatsiri — is that it is a contemporary album that carries a variety of genres. Some songs are in Rhumba, Pasada and other genres to cater for all people. “Our main goal is to preach to as many people as possible, and it helps us when we travel to other nations. As I have said, we travel to many countries preaching the word of God, and that motivates us to produce our songs in different genres,” he said. Parwaringira said his latest offering preaches on preparing for the future and how God changes lives. Gospel Musicians, Tembalami, Tafadzwa Mukaro, brothers Pianos and Tinashe Jaravaza, Tafadzwa Zimuto, Nyasha Mutonhori-Nyaparami are expected to perform at the launch.
