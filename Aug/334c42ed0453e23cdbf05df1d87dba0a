Government has commended African Distillers (Afdis) for complementing its efforts in providing quality health services to patients. Officiating at the handover ceremony of Harare Central Hospital’s Ward B8 that was refurbished by Afdis, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Obadiah Moyo expressed gratitude towards the company’s social responsibility drive. “This obviously came after your exploration of future sustainability in the business world and subsequent development of a strategy that will enable you to grow while at the same time providing benefit to society. “Your support will definitely lessen pressure on the already strained public budget and will thus allow the Government to concentrate on the provision of health for other vulnerable populations in keeping with the universal health coverage theme; ‘leaving no one behind’. The equipment you are seeing in this refurbished ward has been sourced by His Excellency President E.D. Mnangagwa from UAE and India in a quest to improve the health delivery system,’’ said Dr Moyo. Dr Moyo added that Afdis did its part of their corporate social responsibility, which is a process whereby companies integrate, social, environmental and ethical issues into their business operations and strategy. “They voluntarily pursue social and environmental concerns that go further than laws or other norms, because it is in their interest to do so. You have indeed demonstrated that you care about the health of the community and you are playing your part in pushing towards the attainment of the SDGs.” Dr Moyo hailed chief executives in provincial hospitals for listening to Government’s call for effective management in hospitals.
