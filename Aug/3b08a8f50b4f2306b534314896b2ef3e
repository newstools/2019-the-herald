TANYA MUZINDA’S father, Tawanda, says he is humbled by the support coming from the Government. This follows a pledge by the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, Paul Mavima, to support top female motocross rider Tanya in pursuing her dream to turn into a fully-fledged professional racer. Muzinda is preparing to compete in this year’s American motocross season which concludes with the staging of the Thor Supercross and Motocross Winter Olympics in Florida in November. As part of the efforts to support the young rider, Friends of Tanya, in association with the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, will tomorrow host a cocktail fund-raising function at Zimparks Garden. They are looking at raising US$152 000 for Muzinda. “The bulk of the budget has to do with the equipment. Most races in America will be in different States. So, the bulk of the budget is going towards equipment and the rest is for the upkeep. “We are very grateful to the Government for coming through the Minister, he is actually hands on. We have been having meetings. “Looking at where Tanya has reached it’s not just success for Tanya but for Zimbabwe, Africa and the Girl Child. ‘’We are very excited Government has come in to raise funds for her. All she has been doing was with a minimum budget, so you can’t really get to the highest level with a minimum budget,” said Tawanda. The young motocross star’s profile has been on the rise and is next month set to receive an award at this year’s Child Summit and Awards in Accra, Ghana.  Young Achievers founder Mike Bere, who is part of the organisers for tomorrow’s function, said they saw it fit to support Muzinda considering her achievements. “We saw it as a very good thing to do as Young Achievers since we always push agendas for young people who want to make it in life. ‘’So us, as Young Achievers, we just said let’s partner with Tanya and Friends and be able to push this whole initiative.’’
