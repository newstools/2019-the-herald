PRINCE DUBE continued his recent good form by scoring the only goal to help Highlanders beat Chapungu 1-0 in a Castle lager Premiership match at Barbourfields yesterday. The striker, who struck a hat-trick for the Warriors at the same venue in a CHAN qualifier on Sunday against Mauritius, scored from the penalty spot to make the difference yesterday. It was his fourth goal in the last four games. However, while Bosso were celebrating, city rivals Chicken Inn failed to catch up with leaders FC Platinum when they were held to a goalless draw by TelOne at Ascot. The Gamecocks, who now trail the platinum miners by two points, could have taken over leadership of the race with a win yesterday. This was the first Premiership match at Ascot this season after PSL gave the hosts TelOne the green-light following renovations. Telone had been forced to relocate to Barbourfields in Bulawayo. “As you are aware, we have been inactive for two weeks and that sort of killed our rhythm,’’ said Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas. “We deserved to win and I feel that we should have collected the maximum points. We created two good chances but failed to score. “We dominated for the greater part of the game but that finishing touch deserted us’’.
