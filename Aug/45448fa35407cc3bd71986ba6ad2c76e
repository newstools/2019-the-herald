TELONE, who have a Premier League club based in Gweru, have provided $300 000 for the renovation of Ascot. Gweru City Mayor Josiah Makomb, told a full council last week that some of the refurbishments at the stadium were done while others were in progress. “TelOne assisted with $300 000 towards renovation of Ascot Stadium. ‘’Already we have drilled a borehole, renovated changing rooms, bought 36 000 bricks and 100 litres of paint that were delivered, among other provisions for the renovations.” Makombe, however, said they still need more money to complete the renovations. “However we still need an estimated price of $55 000 for aluminium reserve goal posts, $100 000 for the VIP shed, $50 000 for VIP seats, $100 000 for painting of changing rooms, $100 000 for repairing of drainage systems, construction of public toilets, durawall, scoreboards and gate,” he said. Last year, Gweru residents were irked by the failure by the council to renovate the stadium.
