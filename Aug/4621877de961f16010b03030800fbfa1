MICRO-INSURANCE concern, Coverlink, have unveiled a $500 000 sponsorship package to Women’s Soccer League log leaders Black Rhinos Queens for the remainder of the season. The Kuda Matuwi-coached side are in top form having won 13 and drawn just once in the 14 games they have played this season. And they have been rewarded, midway through the season, with Coverlink coming in to sponsor them. Speaking on the sidelines of a kit unveiling ceremony for the team in Harare yesterday, Coverlink marketing manager, Janet Nedi, said her organisation has decided to partner with Black Rhinos in support of the girl child. “Black Rhinos Queens, a team from the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, are doing well in the league and they have taken it upon themselves to help out the girl child. “We are coming in as partners and we will be paying salaries for civilian players in the team as well as allowances, including winning bonuses, for all squad members,” she said. Guest of honour at the event, Ephias Mahachi, hailed the partnership. “As part of its corporate social responsibility, Coverlink Investments is promoting the girl child through such sponsorship which is in sync with the national agenda of promoting gender equality. “Black Rhinos Queens came into being to also promote the girl child. “The team has become a dominant force in the country and beyond. They have also become the cornerstone of the national team,” he said. Black Rhinos Queens also have a juniors’ team which Coverlink have taken under its wings.
