Zimbabwe’s premier trade promotion body, ZimTrade, has been commended by Botswana President Dr Mokgweetsi Masisi for the role it plays in strengthening economic relations between the two neighbours. President Masisi said this yesterday in Gaborone after visiting the ZimTrade pavilion at the ongoing Global Expo Botswana. ZimTrade regional manager Mr Similo Nkala told The Herald yesterday that he had a “brief chat” with President Masisi, who praised them for their determination to encourage trade between Harare and Gaborone.
“I had a brief chat with President Masisi during his tour of the exhibition area,” said Mr Nkala. “President Masisi commended ZimTrade for its part at the Global Expo Botswana saying it (ZimTrade) strengthens trade relations between two countries. “President Masisi said ZimTrade should facilitate more and more exhibitors from Zimbabwe next year.”
Zimbabwe and Botswana are close allies who have elevated their relations to Bi-National Commission (BNC) from Joint Permanent Commission on Cooperation (JPCC), beginning this year. The two countries penned eight agreements including on diamond processing during the inaugural BNC held in February this year. The move to elevate relations was in line with President Mnangagwa’s diplomatic re-engagement and engagement efforts aimed at unlocking mutually beneficial relations. Mr Nkala said Zimbabwe has 15 companies exhibiting in the Global Expo Botswana.
He said the visitors to the ZimTrade pavilion have been “impressed that we are still manufacturing, especially given the quality products on display at the show”. The Global Expo Botswana, which ends on Friday is expected to open new opportunities for participating companies and strengthen existing business links. The Expo is an annual multi-sectoral exhibition organised by the Botswana Investment and Trade Centre (BITC).
