We found the initiative very valuable in the year 2016, the group partnered with Udugu Institute to create B2C, a co-working space and incubator at one of Old Mutual’s properties. “There have been successful stories from the space including Golix (a bit-coin trading platform) and 263 chat a social media company,” said Mr Mushosho.
