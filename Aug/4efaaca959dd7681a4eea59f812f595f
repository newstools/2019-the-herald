The Herald Manicaland Bureau Chief\
MDC-Alliance demonstrations that were set for Mutare yesterday suffered a stillbirth after residents ignored the call and went about their daily chores. Police on Wednesday issued a prohibition notice stopping the demonstrations arguing previous such acts by the MDC Alliance in Mutare had turned violent. Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs Dr Ellen Gwaradzimba had urged people to ignore the opposition call for demonstrations. She said the province was focused on projects to uplift the people’s lives and not on destructive demonstrations. Minister Gwaradzimba said it was a shame the MDC-A was organising demonstrations in a province mourning the loss of loved ones to Cyclone Idai. Chipinge and Chimanimani were the most affected by the cyclone, which destroyed infrastructure close to a billion dollars and killed hundreds. And when The Herald went around the city people could be seen at banking halls, civic centre and their workstations in the city. School children on holiday lessons were also all over the city going to their respective learning centres. People interviewed said the demonstrations served no purpose. The Zimbabwe Republic Police deployed officers at all strategic points in the city. Riot police in full gear could be seen at times engaging people suspected to be potential trouble  causers. Business people in the eastern border city had also expressed fears the demonstrations were likely to result in loss of property. It was business as usual in the central business district.
