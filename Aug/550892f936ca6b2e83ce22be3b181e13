I am confident and the girls’ morale is very high,’’ said Sibanda. Correctional Queens coach, Christopher Simeon is also expecting a bruising contest. “We know it’s going to be a tough game since it’s going to be a decider for the championship. “In terms of experience, and combinations, I think we are better than them. . .we are not worried about them, we know they are still trying to gel together. “Netball is not just about coming together, it’s about combinations.
