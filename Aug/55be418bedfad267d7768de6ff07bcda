The Herald LONDON. — We all thought Chris Gayle’s 301st one-day cricket game for West Indies against India on Wednesday would be his last — except for the man himself. Gayle (39) scored 72 in his side’s defeat by India in what had been expected to be his final match. But the batsman — who recently surpAAAassed Brian Lara’s ODI run record which now stands at 10,481 — is playing on “until further notice”. In June, Gayle reversed his original decision to retire after the World Cup. Gayle, who usually wears the number 45, wore a specially-printed shirt with the number 301 on the back at the third ODI against India at the Queen’s Park Oval. But his 72 in 41 balls, 62 of those scored on the boundary, was not enough to help his side avoid defeat — and a 3-0 series loss. Gayle left the field waving his bat aloft, soaking up the warm and prolonged applause from the crowd, a gesture indicating that would be the last time he would be wearing West Indies colours. India captain Virat Kohli’s impressive 114 helped his side to a six wicket victory on the DLS method, and he was also swept up by the occasion, gushing about how Gayle was a “gem of a human being” and “always kind” as a tribute to his former Royal Challengers Bangalore team-mate upon his retirement.— BBC Sport.
