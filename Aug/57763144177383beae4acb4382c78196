ZIMBABWE Cricket interim managing director Vince Hogg yesterday said he was disappointed by the behaviour of the players and office staff who continue to ignore the call by the interim board to return to work. The ZC employees were given a deadline to report for duty yesterday but the majority stayed away as the current standoff in the domestic game looks far from being over. “Unfortunately we didn’t get a very good response from the staff. We had a few players and staff members that heeded the call but the majority didn’t come. “We understand the situation ZC is in but what we want to do is to make sure that they are paid their salaries so that they get on with their careers. “The welfare of the players and staff is our biggest concern at the moment. So we are simply saying come back to work while your salaries and other issues are being worked out. “But it’s disappointing when some of the staff don’t support the efforts. We have to get things back on the right tracks. “I actually feel for the staff and the players and that is why we have made them the priority. What we want is for sanity to prevail and have cricket games being played again but it can only happen with everyone doing their bit. “So, we will have to discuss this with the board for the way forward,” said Hogg.
