GOSPEL musician Mathias Mhere is overwhelmed by the demand for tickets of the Hossana Pakufamba Concert set for Harare Gardens on September 7. Mhere told Herald Arts that he was forced to print an additional batch of tickets after the initial consignment sold out. Hossana Pakufamba Concert is aimed at celebrating the successful reception of his album “Greater Than Solomon”. Various gospel musicians, especially those he collaborated with, are expected to perform at the show. “On the first batch we printed 3 500 tickets and as it stands that batch has been sold out, and we are working on printing between 2000- 2 500 more tickets,” he said. “We are looking forward to a great show. I hope this show brings back those vibes whereby if a person attends a gospel concert sick, that person will not go back home the same.” He said he was still in negotiations with some of the artistes, who will be performing on the day. “Jah Prayzah is going to be the guest artiste and I am still in talks with other artistes; but I promise you it is going to be a wonderful and blessed day,” said Mhere. “We are also going to be releasing a video “Tirikufamba”, which features Jah Prayzah, and we will also be recording a live DVD video on the day.” The pint-sized musician has been staging various live performances across the country.
