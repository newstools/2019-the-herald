ZIMBABWE Sables coach Brendan Dawson says his men are ready to take on Kenya in a Victoria Cup fixture at Hartsfield this afternoon. Addressing the media on the eve of the clash between the Sables and Simbas, Dawson said Kenya were blessed with incredible talent when they have the ball in hand. Because of that, he feels, the Sables have to be at their best to hold back the Kenyans.
“They are a top quality unit and we going to obviously expect exactly what they come with every year, top quality rugby,’’ said Dawson. ‘’Kenyans play the same style of rugby, quick runners, they like to ship the ball wide, they have some big boys who run in the middle with the ball. ‘’They have unbelievable skills with the ball in hand, it’s going to be hard for us if we don’t contain that and deprive them of the ball, it’s going to be a long day chasing the leather.’’ Skipper Hilton Mudariki said they were desperate to beat the Kenyans. “We’ve really had a good week of training, we are going into this game wanting to win, for us it’s just about the process, sticking to want we want to do, achieving our game plan and working towards that,’’ Mudariki said. Paul Odera, the Kenyan coach, says Zimbabwe could be tough opponents for them. “As usual, Zimbabwe normally have very quick, agile backs, particularly their wings and fullback, from the matches we’ve watched this year, they playing with a lot of width and quite a bit of pace,’’ he said.
