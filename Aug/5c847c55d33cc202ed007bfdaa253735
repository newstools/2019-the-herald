HERENTALS coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva believes they can complete a league double over Dynamos. The two sides clash in a Castle Lager Premiership football match at Rufaro this afternoon. Mutiwekuziva’s troops were the last team to beat the Glamour Boys at this venue when Juan Mutudza’s strike buried them then coached by Lloyd Chigowe. “Of course, my team has drawn too many games and we are trailing Dynamos by six points as they have been doing well, of late, but we are going all out to attack them,’’ said Mutiwekuziva. “We managed to beat them in the reverse encounter at the same stadium and I don’t see anything stopping us from repeating the same feat. “They are a tough team to crack, given their confidence levels and stature, but I believe we have gained enough league experience to face and beat any team in the top-flight.’’ Herentals have 23 points to their name after 20 matches. “As I have said, we have been our own enemies in this marathon, drawing too many games. “We have only lost three matches but then we are too far off the mark as we dropped many points in those draws,” Mutiwekuziva said. Herentals have been boosted by the return of the duo of Warriors midfielder Richard Hachiro and defender Blessing Maunganidze. They missed last weekend’s match against Yadah through suspension. Meanwhile, Ngezi Platinum coach Erol Akbay, under pressure having seen his charges drop seven points in the last three matches, has described their match against Chicken Inn at Luveve as a must-win.
