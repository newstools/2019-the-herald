ZIMBABWE’S international midfielder Thabani Kamusoko is this weekend set to make his continental debut for his new Zambian football team Zesco United in the CAF Champions League. They take on eSwatini champions Black Mamba in a preliminary round, first leg away date. Kamusoko, who was part of the Warriors squad for this year’s AFCON finals in Egypt, joined Zesco from Tanzanian giants Young Africans. The deal was brokered by former CAPS United midfielder Butler Masango. Masango is now based in Johannesburg, South Africa, where, apart from running a football academy, he is now a player intermediary. “A number of South African clubs wanted to sign Kamusoko but we opted for Zesco United because they will offer him huge exposure as they are always playing in the CAF Champions League where they always do well,’’ said Masango. “So, we looked at that aspect and we opted for the Zambian club who offered him a two-year contract with an option of extending it. “It’s a good deal and he is happy at Zesco United. “Thabani came with his wife to Johannesburg and I had the contract and we signed. “It’s my duty to help these young boys. I have been approached by quite a number of players and I will try my best to assist them.’’ Kamusoko (31), a former FC Platinum player, joined Zesco after a brilliant showing for the Warriors at this year’s COSAFA Cup tournament in South Africa where they reached the semi-finals. He was then included in the Warriors squad for the AFCON finals in Egypt. According to reports from Zambia, the dread-locked Zimbabwean midfielder is one of four continental debutants in Zesco United’s travelling party for this tie. The other new faces at Zesco United are Zambia’s Saviour Nkonkola, Umaru Kasumba of Uganda and Japan’s Kosuke Nakamachi.
