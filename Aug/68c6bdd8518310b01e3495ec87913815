The Herald Lloyd Mwale in MHONDORO Ngezi Platinum ………………………..0 Triangle…………………………………(1) 1 TRIANGLE tore the form book apart as a Russell Madamombe spot kick was enough for the visitors to collect maximum points in this Castle Lager Premiership contest. The hosts finished the contest with nine men after two of their troops were shown red cards. A fine solo run on the right flank by Triangle captain Ralph Kawondera ended with him feeding Madamombe whose effort beat goalkeeper Nelson Chadya. Ngezi defender Ariel Makopa was adjudged to have used his hand to stop the ball from crossing the line and referee Munyaradzi Majoni pointed to the spot before flashing a red card on the defender. Upstepped Madamombe to send Chadya the wrong way In the second half, the hosts tried to come back into the game but were dealt another blow when Marlon Mushonga was shown another red card by Majoni for an off-the-ball incident involving Anelka Chivandire. Ngezi coach Erol Akbay blamed the referee. “The referee has defeated us today. The football authorities must do something to such kinds of match officiating,’’ he said. Triangle coach Taurayi Mangwiro welcomed the three points. “We needed the three points more than Ngezi. You see, we had six changes to the team that played in an international match and it paid for us,’’ he said.
