The Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Climate and Rural Resettlement has allocated 10 hectares of land to the youth in every administrative district, which will be used for sustainable agricultural projects. Zanu-PF Deputy Secretary for Youth Affairs Cde Lewis Matutu disclosed the deal at a Zimbabwe Wellness and Tree Planting event held in Harare on Friday. The initiative, Cde Matutu said, will enable the youth to have a sustainable flow of income and positive impact on a socio-economic scale. “Through the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Climate and Rural Resettlement, young people have been given 10 hectares per administrative district to allow them to kick-start viable agrarian projects that will enable them to have a sustainable income and impact positively on a socio-economic scale,” said Cde Matutu. “This initiative was set up to boost rural productivity and reduce rural to urban migration by young people. In addition to that, sustainable access to water and sanitation, particularly for young women and girls, can enable them to regularly and safely participate in productive activities.”
