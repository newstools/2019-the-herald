The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter HERENTALS director Innocent Benza says his club will send more players for attachment at a UK-based academy, Future Lions. The team’s striker, Tinotenda Benza, was the first to get the opportunity and he completed his five-week dance last week. Benza said the ambitious club was negotiating for a twinning relationship with the UK academy which will see not just players, but members of the technical team also going for attachment at the institution. “We have been working in the background, trying to seal a lucrative deal with a UK football academy with a view to improve the performance of our team. “Tino (Benza) was the first to go there for an attachment and spent five weeks learning some technical, mental and tactical aspects of the game. “He came back last week and you could see he is now an improved player. But that is only the beginning. “We will be occasionally sending our players for that programme as we want to become a professional footballing institution who play and behave professionally,” said Benza. Tinotenda, who is Benza’s son, said the time he spent with the UK academy was priceless. “It was quite an experience with the academy in the UK. I have always been working hard to sharpen my goal-scoring skills and I believe what I learnt in the UK will eventually solve the problem,” he said. “I’m still learning, but the attachment gave me a bit of knowledge and it is something that I would like my teammates to also experience for the good of the team. “It also taught me to train hard and play smart. “Best thing you should do in football is use your mind and as we go on I’ll be helping my teammates here using what I learnt back in England.” Herentals will today take on Yadah.
