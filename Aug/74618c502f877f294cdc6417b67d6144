FORMER Darryn T, Fire Batteries and Kaizer Chiefs legend Mike Maringa has expressed concern over the flawed training methods junior football players in Zimbabwe are subjected to. The 47-year-old, who was one of the first local players to don the famous Amakhosi jersey back in 1994, is now working in Watford, England. The Dutchman, as he was nicknamed way back, was recently back in Zimbabwe for a two-week vacation.
“The thing is, Zimbabwe has got talent. There is no doubt about that but the constant problem is, we do not subject our youngsters to the right training regime,” he said. “There is definitely no way a 10-year-old boy should be made to play a size-5 ball.
“There is also no way they should play an 11-a-side game using the standard pitch which ordinarily is for the mature players. “It’s like rushing a pupil to Grade 5 before they even grasp the concepts of ECD, no matter how brilliant that pupil will be, they will always show something is missing. “It’s about doing the right thing at the right time. It comes down to scientific approach to training. As long as we fail to do that, we will always have the same problems.” Maringa was also an integral part of the Young Warriors side which won the Cosafa Cup in Lesotho in 1990.
He lined up with the likes of Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera, Morgan Nkathazo and Vitalis Takawira in that all-conquering Under-20 side. “I have to start an academy and one thing which I will do is make sure it has qualified coaches.
“It’s about doing things properly and that way our football will go far.”
