MIGHTY Warriors skipper Talent Mandaza says they are fully aware of the threat posed by a Zambian side which has always been their bogey side as they meet in the second round Olympic qualifiers at Nkoloma Stadium tomorrow. The reverse fixture will be played on Sunday at the National Sports Stadium. The Mighty Warriors left for Lusaka by road yesterday and veteran midfielder Mandaza believes they have done their homework well against a familiar side which they have played numerous times. “The Zambia game is a derby match which will be very tough. They are a physical team but we have prepared for them because we really know them,” she said. The Black Rhinos midfielder says they will go for the jugular during tomorrow’s first leg tie. Usually the Mighty Warriors do well away and appear to choke at home. “With Zambia, we normally don’t have a home or away match, our games are just intense but we are just hoping for an away goal and at the same time avoiding defeat. We are going all out for victory,” said Mandaza. The Zimbabwe senior women’s soccer team participated at the 2016 Rio Games where they made history as the first football team to feature at such prestigious Games. However, Mandaza reckons that’s it’s a mean task repeating that feat again and qualifying for the Tokyo Games in Japan next year.
