The Herald LONDON. — Anthony Joshua’s highly-anticipated woprld heavyweight boxing rematch with Andy Ruiz (Jnr) is set to take place in Saudi Arabia on December 7. The bout is expected to be worth up to £82 million with Riyadh beating Dubai to stage the blockbuster showdown. Joshua (29) was said to be considering Cardiff’s Principality Stadium and the Madison Square Garden in New York to host the Ruiz rematch. But the Telegraph claim that Saudi Arabia will officially be confirmed as the host of the heavyweight showdown later today. AJ and Ruiz have been actively trying to find a “neutral ground” for their blockbuster bout recently. The Brit’s prompter Eddie Hearn said: “I know, I think, where the fight is going, but I just have to wait for some paperwork to be tied up and then we’ll make an announcement. “Cardiff is still a major option. We have two or three other options around the world for neutral venues.” And Riyadh has emerged as a shocking but viable option that could satisfy both fighters. Saudi Arabia is now set to organise another major boxing contest having staged Amir Khan’s victory over Billy Dib in July. Joshua will head to the Middle East hoping to inflict revenge on Ruiz (29) and claw his WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles back. The Brit lost the belts on June 1, suffering a humiliating seventh-round defeat by the Mexican underdog at MSG in New York. Ruiz floored Joshua four times on the way to pull off one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. – The Sun
