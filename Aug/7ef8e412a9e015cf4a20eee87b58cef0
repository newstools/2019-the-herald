There is nothing tough, nothing easy in this game. “We have come to play rugby, we have to make sure we make people smile back home. We have not come here to tour Zimbabwe, time for touring will come. “We are fully prepared, as I said, we are not here for touring, we are here for business. “We haven’t focused on one area, for rectifications, but we have prepared all departments for this game. “We have made some changes to the team, bringing some good players.’’ Zimbabwe are top of the four-team log having prevailed over Kenya, Uganda and Zambia in the first leg clashes.
