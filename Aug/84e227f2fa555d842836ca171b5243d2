The Herald Oscar Rusenga in CHIREDZI
HIGH-RIDING Triangle are itching to sink their teeth into Highlanders in a Castle Lager Premiership football match at Gibbo today. The Sugar Sugar Boys have now gone 12 games without tasting defeat in all competitions. They are unbeaten in 10 league matches. Their latest wins include back-to-back victories against platinum miners Ngezi Platinum and FC Platinum in a space of four days. Triangle’s watertight defence, commanded by Donald Dzvinyai and Kudzi Chigwida, has been the reason for their good form. The two are complemented well by their wingbacks Arnold Chivheya and Obey Mwerahari. And Triangle captain Ralph Kawondera believes his side will continue with their fine today. “We have a very good balanced squad, when given a chance the guys are doing their best because to tell you the truth, when you are on the field of play and you look at the bench, you must be thankful of the minutes you get,’’ he said. ‘’Someone can come in and do the same or even better. “It’s very good competition and that also gives us confidence despite the games coming thick and fast. ‘’We have depth and quality to counter the fatigue. We are ready for Highlanders, we have beaten them before and we can do it again.’’ Triangle’s game against Bosso will be their fifth game in three weeks. Their assistant coach, Tafadzwa Mashiri, was adamant that despite a lot of pressure, they were ready for Bosso. “We are coming from very texting matches, and a lot of travelling. We played two CAF Confederation Cup games against Rukinzo and both games required a lot of travelling. ‘’We also played Ngezi and FC Platinum and those were high-profile matches.  “We are going to welcome Highlanders before we travel again for a clash against Chapungu on Sunday and we are considering a bit of rotation of our squad to maintain energy levels. “Highlanders are one of the biggest teams in the country, they have a good coach.’’
