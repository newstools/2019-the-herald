THE ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League championship resumes this afternoon with two matches lined at Motor Action and Dzivaresekwa. Herentals U-20 will face Grain Tigers in the reverse fixture at Motor Action after the two sides shared the spoils at Aspindale. Harare City Cubs face Chegutu Pirates at Dzivaresekwa. Herentals U-20 coach, Paul Benza, who have lost at least five players during the break, said they will give the Tigers a good run. “We have not rested since the mid-season break and we are looking forward to the match. We have a lot of talented players who can feel the void. “We haven’t revised our target of a top-four finish and during this second round it is what we will be working on. “We know Grain Tigers have improved after they changed their technical bench so we will give them the respect but we need maximum points,’’ said Benza.
