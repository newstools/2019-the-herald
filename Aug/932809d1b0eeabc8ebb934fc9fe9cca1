THERE is no prize money for Miss Tourism Harare provincial pageant to be held on September 7 at a local hotel in the capital, organisers have revealed. The winner will book a ticket to represent the province at the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe finale. Thirty models drawn from Harare Metropolitan, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East and West provinces have booked their tickets to participate at the national finale. The pageant’s licence holder, Mercy “Catwalk” Mushaninga, said their focus was not on prizes, but to make it standard for winners from all provinces. “We want to match with other provinces. As you know, all eyes will be on Harare so if we decide to focus on prizes others will think that we have belittled their provinces. “So, to make it fair, we decided that the queen and her princesses will automatically qualify to represent the province at the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe. “There is no prize money for the pageant. However, we are not closing doors for potential sponsors if they are willing to assist, but for the time being this is our position,” she said. Mushaninga, who founded Zim Gossip Modelling Agency, also said the finalists will this weekend take part at the parade billing in Harare’s CBD, which will be part of promoting the Sanganai/ Hlangani Tourism Expo set for next month. “We have partnered with the tourism sector and our girls will be parading for Sanganai/Hlangani from Africa Unity Square to Rainbow Towers. They will attend the International Cultural Food Festival to be held at Jam Tree in Harare,” she said. She added that Rose Moyo, Nyasha Chamakudhengu affectionately known as Chamaz and Floreta Chikomwe will be the hosts. “Afro jazz songstress, Diana ‘MaNgwenya’ Samkange, Baka Ngwasuma and Ishan of the ‘Kure’ fame are billed to perform at the event. “We have five judges on our panel with local designer Melusi idoing the garments for the girls,”
