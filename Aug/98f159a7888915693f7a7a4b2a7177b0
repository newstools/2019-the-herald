CLEMENCE ZIMONDI’S exquisite first-half strike was enough to carry the day for Mushowani in this absorbing Premiership encounter on a chilly afternoon at Rufaro yesterday. Zimondi benefited from a clever hard-and-low Amon Kambanje cross from the right which caught the Yadah defence off-guard. Yet, up to that point, it was the home side who had bombarded the opposite end but all their incessant questions got good answers from Mushowani goalkeeper Admire Masuku. Then the visitors took charge of this free-flowing match from the point they scored though some sticky calls by controversial referee Thabani Bamala threatened to rub the gloss off the exciting tie. Mushowani eased their relegation worries as they took their tally to 17 points from as many matches. Mushowani coach Newman Mashipe was all praises for his charges. “What we have been trying to implement is slowly coming out perfectly. I am quite impressed with how the boys played, defensively and offensively. We are already looking forward to our next match,” he said. Yadah coach Genesis Mangombe, whose central defence pair of Sydney Linyama and Morris Musiyakuvi had to be substituted due to injuries, said they were going back to the drawing board. Teams
