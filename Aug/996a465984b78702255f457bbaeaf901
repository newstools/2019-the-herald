The Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe is seeking partners to develop nine renewable energy projects that are expected to add over 250MW into the national grid. In an advertisement yesterday calling for expressions of interest from local and/or international investors, the IDBZ said the proposed initiatives were expected to plug power shortages. “The bank’s thrust in the energy generation sub-sector is to also broaden the overall national energy mix with emphasis of renewable energy,” said IDBZ. The projects include Osborne Mini Hydro, Marondera solar farm, Gutu solar farm, Plumtree solar project, GDE Bulilima solar energy, Gwayi and the NUST solar projects. “In Mutasa district, there is Odzani Mini Hydro project which will utilise the existing water canals and weirs at Odzani River which were previously used for hydro power generation,” said IDBZ.
