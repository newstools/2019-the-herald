AS Zimbabwe brace up for this year’s FIM Africa Motocross of African Nations Championships, hopes are high that local riders will give it their best shot when over 200 participants meet for the event slated for this weekend at Donnybrook Park in Harare. The championships will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Team Zimbabwe is made up of 59 riders and will be captained by South Africa-based MX1 Class rider Jayden Ashwell. Jamie Kerwin, the public relations officer for the Bogwheelers Club who run motocross in Zimbabwe on behalf of Motorsport Zimbabwe, said the team has been training at Donnybrook every weekend for the past weeks with some of the country’s elite riders such as Josh Goby, Tristan Grainger and Regan Wasmuth leading the sessions. However, he indicated that practice is over now as the track has been closed in preparation for the main event. “The captain is Jayden Ashwell, he is a very well-known local rider. He is already in the country and the team has been practicing tirelessly. They have been preparing every weekend at the track at Donnybrook. “They have been doing three to four hours of training every Saturday and some of the senior, elite riders have been running the training sessions. But there are no more sessions as the track is closed in preparation for the event. So practice is over,” said Kerwin. Promising female rider, Tadiwanashe Nyamupfukudza (12), who was part of Team Zimbabwe for the championships, has been ruled out because of an injury.
