The Herald Oscar Rusenga in TRIANGLE
TRIANGLE  venture into unknown territory when they begin their maiden CAF Confederation Cup campaign against Burundi side Rukinzo FC at Barbourfields tomorrow. The Zimbabwean side will use Barbourfields after their home ground, Gibbo, failed to meet CAF standards. “We arrived in Bulawayo yesterday (Thursday) and we are having a feel of the pitch. We will also train tomorrow and I am confident that we will come out with a positive result,’’ coach Taurai Mangwiro said. “We need to play well at home before we travel to Bujumbura for the reverse fixture. “It won’t be an easy fixture for both teams since we don’t know each other, but we will play our game and hope that the boys will execute what we have been doing at training. “I believe with the quality that we have and the support that we have been receiving from our sponsors so far, we will win it for Triangle and the country. “We are not just representing brand Tongaat Hullet, but the whole country and we invite fans from across the country to come and support us.’’ A number of Triangle fans in the Lowveld, and around the country will travel for the game, which is one of their biggest matches since being promoted back in 2013. Triangle supporters’ chairman Misheck Muyambo was ecstatic about the way things have unfolded for the Sugar Sugar Boys. “We are very grateful to our sponsors for making this happen during these difficult times. We also thank our technical team and players for making it this far after winning the coveted Chibuku Super Cup last year. “I also want to salute my fellow supporters for rallying behind this beautiful club through thick and thin.”
