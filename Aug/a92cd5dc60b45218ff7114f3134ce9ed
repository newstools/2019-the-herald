Local private companies must consider participating in tenders on rehabilitation and upgrading of public health institutions under private-public partnerships, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Obadiah Moyo has said. Speaking soon after touring Cimas’ new state-of-the-art laboratory in Harare on Friday, Dr Moyo said the same services offered by private institutions should be available in public institutions. “We are in the process of creating partnerships in Government and we would like to see partnerships between laboratories like yourself with us in Government,” he said. “I don’t see any reason why we should be bringing someone from India to be our partner in a Government laboratory when Cimas is here, when we have other laboratories who have the capability.” Speaking at the same occasion, Cimas managing director, Mr Vulindlela Ndlovu, said public private partnerships were the way to go, but bemoaned the current economic environment, which he said could impact negativity on their efforts as private sector to collaborate with Government.
