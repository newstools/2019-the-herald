The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United and Juventus have agreed a swap deal in principle involving Paulo Dybala and Romelu Lukaku, according to Sky in Italy. The deal is now said to hinge on Dybala agreeing terms with United. Jorge Antun, one of the player’s representatives, is understood to be in London for talks with United over a move to Old Trafford. Dybala is valued at €100m (£91.8m) and is keen to stay but wants to meet with head coach Maurizio Sarri before making a final decision, according to Sky in Italy. He will hold a meeting with the former Chelsea boss this week. United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking after Tuesday’s pre-season win over Kristiansund, would not be drawn on a potential deal for Dybala but confirmed new arrivals could be in the offing. “I’m not here to talk about any rumours or speculation about other team’s players,” said Solskjaer. “But of course, we’re working on one or two cases, as I’ve said before. “There’s another 10 days before we start the league and hopefully we can announce a fresh face or two.” Juventus must convince Dybala to make the move to Manchester, as United would require a replacement for Lukaku. If Dybala is unable to agree terms on a move to Old Trafford, Lyon striker Moussa Dembele is also on United’s short-list to replace Lukaku. Should the Argentine refuse to leave Turin, Juve would have to come up with a cash deal but still offload one or more of their current strikers. Pavel Nedved, the Juve vice president, was questioned on Dybala and Lukaku on Monday by Sky in Italy. He said: “We have some offers for Paulo Dybala but we’ll wait to decide about his future. Lukaku? We always try to get players but I don’t want to speak about Lukaku or others.” — Sky Sports.
