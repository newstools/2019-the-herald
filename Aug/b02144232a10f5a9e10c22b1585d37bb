“As we clash against Mauritius in the second leg of the Africa Nations Championships qualifier at Barbourfields, I encourage the entire nation to rally behind our gallant Warriors. “Let us converge in our big numbers at Barbourfields Stadium and give our boys a motivational cheer which will spur them to victory. “Yes, we had a comforting away win in the first leg so I encourage the Warriors to keep up the winning momentum because we are confident they will sail through to the next round,” said Musekiwa.
ZNSSA Northern Region chairman, Supa Mushonga, called on the corporate world, partners and sponsors to be a part of making this trip a success. “We have organised buses to ferry fans to Barbourfields tomorrow (tonight) or early morning on Sunday.
