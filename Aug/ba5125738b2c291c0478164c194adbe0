DEFENDING champion Gideon Teguru faces a tough task to retain his title in the Givemore Marume Classic at the Zimbabwe College of Music in Harare today. Teguru won the second edition of the bodybuilding contest last year after he had missed out at the Zimbabwe National Bodybuilding Muscle and Fitness finals a week earlier. The athlete should expect stiff competition from seasoned bodybuilders like Blessing “CC Banks” Sithole, Lovemore Manyamana of Bulawayo as well as Marondera-based Elliah Samaringa. The 27-year-old Teguru, who is sponsored by Herentals Group of Colleges, is the man to beat. Event organiser Marume, who is a four-time Mr Zimbabwe and six-time Mr Ironman winner, said they started preparations for this year’s edition early as they expect a big turnout. At least 50 athletes are expected to grace the event which has introduced a new division — the physic fitness. “We started our preparations much earlier this year and we are now just doing final touches. ‘’We had a lot of interest and requests from other divisions which we have included in this year’s event,’’ said Marume. The contest will have many partners coming on board with Saltrama being the main sponsor for all the three editions. They will be supported by Royal Flair Events, Fitness First Gym at Colcom, Sundowner Orchards, M.B.S hardware factory, Health and All, Impakt CT, Senchem, High On Talent, Cards Unlimited, Ruvimbo Lodges and Crime Stoppers.
