His effort beat Bizavanhu David in goals for the visitors. Bonface Zuberi then scored from a free-kick after James Gwara had been brought down by Shadreck Nyawa. ZPC then sealed the scoring in the 81st minute through Robson Hunda. Their coach, Godfrey Tamirepi, was a proud man after the match. “We are happy with the momentum we have got and we just need to improve our defending. “We have been conceding unnecessary free kicks which our opponents failed to utilise. “We hope to do better against Yadah on Monday as we have not been playing well away from home.”
