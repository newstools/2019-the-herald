MUTARE will host the second edition of the Manicaland Classic body-building contest at the Crocodile Motel on Saturday. The first edition was held in 2017 and the tournament took a sabbatical last year but will be back, bigger and better, this year. Former Mr Zimbabwe, Tobias Madzime, who is also the Manicaland Body-building Association chairman and competition co-ordinator, said they are expecting a huge turnout. ‘’We are hopeful that this year we will have a better one,’’ he said. ‘’Last year we could not hold one after we did not register on the national calendar early but this year we are back. “There are a lot of expectations and the sponsors are responding well and we call upon athletes from Manicaland to come in their numbers. “As an Open contest, it is for everyone but it will be good for the province to be well represented.” Registration for the participants is already on and there has been a good response from athletes throughout the country. “We started our preparations much earlier this year and we are now just doing the final touches.
