UNITED States-based Zimbabwean amateur golfer Jack Allard returned home to win the Zimbabwe Amateur strokeplay at Chapman over the weekend. Allard, a former Harry Allen Golf Club member, is on a golf scholarship in the United States. And, during his vacation time, he was part of a huge field which battled for points in the national event. Playing off minus-two-handicap, Allard, a freshman at Barry University where he is a finance major, beat 34 other players who had taken to the field in the 54-hole tournament on Saturday and Sunday. Allard, who has won several other local tournaments, had rounds of 75, 73, 72 and 75 for a total 295 to take all the maximum points of the order of merit. The Bulawayo-based player had competition from Lewis Graeme who was three shots behind playing off his zero-handicap as he carded rounds of 71, 75, 80 and 72 for a total 298. Zimbabwe Amateur is one of the high profile national tournaments that are considered for the national team selection for Region V and the Orange Bowl Championships. Promise Sumbreiro managed to finish third from his plus two handicap with scores 70, 72, 74 and and 77 as Norman Mativenga was fourth.
