CAPS United coach Darlington Dodo says he is already missing his mentor Lloyd Chitembwe, but insists he has what it takes to steer Makepekepe to glory. Chitembwe crossed the floor to join Harare City on Monday together with four other members of the club’s technical team. Dodo was appointed to take charge of the Green Machine until the end of the season. “It is unfortunate that coach Lloyd (Chitembwe) has left. We worked very well together and I really miss him,’’ he said. “As his assistant, I was learning a lot from him. I know he also had a lot he was learning from me. “We had actually assembled a very good team together, which has done very well this season right from Day One. “I will keep leading the ship from where he left. I have taken over to just maintain and try to achieve what we had targeted at the beginning of the season. “I was within the system right from the start and I am not worried. Whatever has been happening at CAPS United, we have been doing it together. “So, I am just pursuing what we had already planned. It is only the departure of Chitembwe (Lloyd) but I am also capable of steering the ship.” Dodo’s first assignment is away against Chapungu at Ascot tomorrow. His charges have the chance to go top of the table if they win this match. Dodo knows Chapungu are not easy opponents and has been working with his defence which has struggled to keep clean sheets this season. Chapungu won the reverse fixture at the National Sports Stadium and will be looking to complete a double over Makepekepe. “Yes, we lost to Chapungu at the National Sports Stadium in the first leg but, we have managed to correct some areas where we were lacking and from what I have seen at training I think we are ready. “It’s looking good and we are going to Gweru to play good football.”
