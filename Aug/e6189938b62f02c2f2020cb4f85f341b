The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp says star forward Khama Billiat will make his return to first team action on August 24. The Zimbabwe ace is yet to feature this season as he is reportedly struggling with a niggling knee injury he picked up at the Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Egypt. However, Middendorp says the player is making progress and is due to return in late August ahead of the game against SuperSport United. He told reporters: “He came back from African Cup of Nations in Egypt with an in issue on his left knee, he came exactly on July 15, stayed for four days. “On our trip to Botswana he didn’t travel with the team. We were not planning to play him in the Carling Cup, but requested because he was voted by the supporters and we had to honour that. But immediately after the game he had pain and again we had to do check ups. “On the 30th of July at 11:14am the X-ray scan results came, telling us basically on his left legiment everything was okay but we had to be careful with it. — Sport24.
