The Herald Sports Reporter AHEAD of departure to Zambia for an Olympics qualifier on Monday, Mighty Warriors coach Sithetheliwe Sibanda has named an experienced side that will go into camp today. Zimbabwe play She-polopolo on Wednesday before they host their northern neighbours on Sunday at the National Sports Stadium. Sibanda has retained the bulk of players who featured at the COSAFA Women’s Championships in South Africa early this month. The Mighty Warriors featured at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The winner of the two-legged series will meet the winner of the match between South Africa and Botswana. Sibanda is aware of the threat posed by the Zambians, who reached the COSAFA final, but lost to South Africa. Sibanda has called her experienced players such as regular midfielders Emmaculate Msipa, Marjoury Nyaumwe and skipper Talent Mandaza. Striker Rudo Neshamba, who returned to action at the COSAFA tournament, is expected to lead the team’s attack. Former skipper Onai Chingawo, who came out retirement to play at the COSAFA Championships, has been overlooked for the Lusaka trip. Black Rhinos midfielder Daisy Kaitano, who was in Port Elizabeth, is also not part of the squad which will be trimmed to 18 players.
