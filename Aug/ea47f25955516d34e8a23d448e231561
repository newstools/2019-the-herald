The Herald LONDON. — Juventus and Portugal attacker Cristiano Ronaldo has explained what makes him the best ever footballer over rival Argentinian Lionel Messi. The 34-year-old makes the argument that winning the Champions League with different teams puts him ahead of Messi in the argument of the best ever footballer. “Messi is an excellent player who will be remembered not just for his Ballon d’Or wins, but also for being at the top — like me — year after year,” he explained in the DAZN documentary “The Making Of”. “The difference with me is I played for different clubs and I’ve also won the Champions League with different clubs. “I was the top scorer in the Champions League six times in a row. There also aren’t many players who won the Champions League five times. “Obviously I’ve not seen such a rivalry between two players at the top for so many years. There are great players, who I respect, who were at their peak for a maximum of three, four or at most five years. “Ten years? I’ve never seen that. I’ve never seen players breaking records each year scoring 40 to 50 goals a season, winning titles, always being up there. — AFP.
