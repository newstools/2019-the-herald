The Herald MANCHESTER. — Frank Lampard has warned there will be more harsh lessons for his youthful Chelsea side after Manchester United punished “fatal” errors on his managerial English Premier League football debut on Sunday. Lampard’s Chelsea dominated for periods at Old Trafford, creating more chances and enjoying more possession than their hosts, but were punished for a series of defensive mistakes. Kurt Zouma clumsy foul on Marcus Rashford handed the United striker a first-half penalty, while Anthony Martial and Daniel James benefited for Chelsea errors to condemn Lampard to a 4-0 defeat in his first competitive game in charge of his former club. “Let’s be clear, with the injuries we have and the fact we couldn’t bring in players, this is going to be a work in progress to a degree and we will have to learn harsh lessons and correct them quickly,” the Chelsea boss said. “We are missing internationals and big players, but I don’t want to make excuses. The team we put out today was clearly competing in the game for long periods, but we made four mistakes and they were clinical in the way they put them away.” — Sky Sports.
