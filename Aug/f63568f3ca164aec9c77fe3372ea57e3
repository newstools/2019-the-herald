DYNAMOS coach Tonderai Ndiraya says his charges will be out to protect their home reputation when they face Chicken Inn at Rufaro on Sunday. The Glamour Boys haven’t lost a match at Rufaro since Ndiraya took over from Lloyd Chigowe in April. Their last defeat at their favourite hunting ground was a 0-1 loss at the hands of Herentals on April 22. They have now gone nine matches, with two of those being away ties, at the venue without a loss. With the fit-again Simba Nhivi returning to action after a three-game absence, because of injury, Ndiraya has several options up front. “We lost the reverse encounter (against Chicken Inn) by the way but, lately, we have been doing quite well, particularly at Rufaro,” said Ndiraya. “So, we are banking on that but look, it’s a difficult team that we are playing against. “They have done well this season though they have somewhat dipped in recent matches. “I think we have been boosted by the return of Simba Nhivi. He was among those who were injured. I am sure he is going to give us more options in the final third. “But, we expect them to raise their game when we play them on Sunday. Of course, in terms of quality we are a bit down but I think we are slowly coming out of our shell.’’ Dynamos last beat Chicken Inn in a league match at Rufaro in 2017. “We are aware of that and I think that belongs to the past. We are a different team with young stars who are ready to make their name at Dynamos,’’ said Ndiraya. “We will do everything to try to grind a result. We are Dynamos and we can post a good result any day. “But Chicken Inn are definitely no push-overs. They are fighting for the championship and they are very organised, with a lot of experience.” Dynamos are eighth on the log with 28 points to their name after 19 games and Chicken Inn, who have played one game less, are third with 31 points.
