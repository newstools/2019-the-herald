The Herald LONDON. – Kevin De Bruyne can’t wait to play a key role in Manchester City’s bid for a third successive English Premier League football title as the Belgian star finally returns to peak form and fitness. Pep Guardiola’s side start their title defence at West Ham today with De Bruyne providing a reassuring presence for the champions. City have bolstered their treble-winning squad with the €62 million club record signing of Atletico Madrid midfielder Rodri, while also adding accomplished Juventus full-back Joao Cancelo. But the prospect of De Bruyne driving City forward from midfield is a mouthwatering prospect for Guardiola. The 28-year-old was an influential figure in City’s 2017-18 Premier League title triumph, but he had only a bit-part role in last season’s domestic dominance due to knee and muscular injuries.
