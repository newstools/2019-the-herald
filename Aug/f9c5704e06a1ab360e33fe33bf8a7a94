The Herald LONDON. — Zinedine Zidane is on the brink of quitting Spanish football giants Real Madrid after breaking his promise to Manchester United star Paul Pogba, it has been claimed. Zidane has spent the summer instructing Real Madrid chief Florentino Perez to secure the signature of Manchester United midfielder Pogba. The Los Blancos boss has already had a fruitful transfer window, forking out the likes of Eden Hazard, Luka Jovic, Ferland Mendy and Eder Militao. But Zidane wants Pogba and is adamant the Manchester United star must be signed if they are to compete with the likes of Barcelona and Atletico Madrid for major honours. And, now, journalist Diego Torres has told the Independent that Zidane is on the brink of RESIGNING having not got his man. “Not signing Pogba puts Zidane on the brink of resigning,” Torres, who works for El Pais, said. “Zidane personally promised Pogba he would bring him to Madrid, and now he is left looking bad. “This has only increased the lack of confidence between Zidane and Florentino. “ — The Daily Express.
