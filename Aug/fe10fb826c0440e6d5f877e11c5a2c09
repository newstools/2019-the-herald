The Herald ENGLAND. — If there is one thing as certain as the crawling queues of traffic towards Bournemouth’s beaches on a sunny bank holiday weekend it is the relentless drive of Manchester City. If there is another it is the endless stream of goals from Sergio Aguero who was twice on target as the champions won on the south coast 3-1. Pep Guardiola looked on approvingly in his summer casuals as City banked the points, returned to winning ways after a draw against Tottenham which passes for a blip when you operate at this level of excellence and maintained their steady pursuit of early pace-setters Liverpool. Meanwhile, Newcastle stunned Tottenham 1-0. It was this that Mauricio Pochettino had feared when he started to talk about a life away from Tottenham earlier in the summer. Not a home defeat by Newcastle specifically — nobody could have foreseen such a shock — but a slight regression, a drop in standards. If Pochettino really did wonder if he had taken his club as far as he could on reaching a Champions League final last May, he will have further reason to ponder after this. Nothing felt right at Tottenham over the summer and it was undoubtedly the manager who set the tone. If there has been a manifestation of that on the field then maybe Pochettino should not really be surprised. Elsewhere an ice-cold penalty from Raúl Jiménez earned Wolves a point at the last gasp after an impressive performance from Burnley had not only kept the hosts out but at arm’s length for 90 minutes. VAR confirmed the verdict of the referee, Craig Pawson, that Jiménez had been fouled by Erik Pieters in second-half stoppage time as the pair looked to challenge following a deflected Rúben Neves shot. — MailOnline.
