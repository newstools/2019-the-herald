The Herald KARACHI.  –  Pakistan thanked Sri Lankan yesterday for helping them bring Test cricket back to the country for the first time since the 2009 attack on the same visitors led to international matches being suspended. Pakistan’s players went to the Sri Lanka dressing room to thank them soon after the home team posted a convincing 263-run win in the second Test of the their first home series in a decade. The victory gave Pakistan a 1-0 series win following the rain-ravaged draw in the first Test in Rawalpindi. Pakistan captain Azhar Ali said his country owed a big thank you to Sri Lanka. “They have given us immense happiness by playing in Pakistan,” said Azhar after his team wrapped up victory in just 14 minutes of play on the fifth day. Sri Lanka – set 476 to win – were bowled out for 212, with teenaged Pakistan paceman Naseem Shah taking five for 31.  – AFP.
