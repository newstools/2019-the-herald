The Herald After months of waiting, the trailer for Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has been released, featuring Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black. Unlike the in the first film where Jumanji was a board game, the second has been given a 2017 twist, becoming a video-game.
And, rather than the real-world being flooded with animals, the teenagers who discover the game are transported into the TV screen, becoming their avatars. As seen, Alex Wolff becomes The Rock, Ser’Darius Blain turns into Kevin Hart, Madison Iseman into Jack Black, and Morgan Turner into Karen Gillan. Recently, Black spoke about the how they will honour Robin Williams with the sequel: “We’re exploring this jungle and trying to conquer the game; it’s life or death. But while we’re there, we find clues left behind by [Williams’ character Alan Parrish]. He built up a full-blown jungle house, similar to a Swiss Family Robinson situation. It’s like he’s there helping us without actually being there.”
Black went on to describe the key difference between the new film and the original, which co-starred Bonnie Hunt and Kirsten Dunst. He said: “[In the original] you never got to see the inside world. But this one takes place primarily inside the jungle of Jumanji. That’s the coolest part of the film — we’re able to transport the audience to that secret and wondrous land, with the danger and the beauty.” — Independent-Uk.
