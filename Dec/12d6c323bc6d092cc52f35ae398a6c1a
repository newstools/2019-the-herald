The Herald LONDON. — Struggling West Ham said on Sunday they had appointed David Moyes as manager for the second time in a bid to safeguard their place in the English Premier League. Moyes, whose career has never recovered from a deeply unsuccessful spell as Manchester United boss in 2013-2014, succeeds Manuel Pellegrini, who was sacked after a 2-1 defeat to Leicester on Saturday that left the Hammers just one point above the relegation zone. The 56-year-old has been without a club since leaving West Ham after a six-month spell in the 2017-2018 season. Moyes guided West Ham to safety that season after Slaven Bilic was dismissed in early November and will be tasked with doing the same for a second time. “It’s fabulous to be back,” said Moyes in a club statement. “I’m feeling very proud that I’m back here at West Ham. “But I think more importantly I’ll be looking to see what I can do and what I can make improvements to. “I do believe that the squad of players I’ve got here is a better squad of players than when I took over before, so I am looking forward to working with them.” The West Ham hierarchy were keen to make a swift appointment following Pellegrini’s sacking ahead of Wednesday’s crucial clash with fellow strugglers Bournemouth at the London Stadium. —AFP.
