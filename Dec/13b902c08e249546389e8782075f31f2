THE Zimbabwe Golf Association have released the 2020 calendar with several high-profile matches lined up for local amateurs. The season will start as early as February 1 with the Dugmore Trophy and end on December 24 with the Orange Bowl set for the United States. ZGA, which are under scrutiny over the way they are running the affairs of the sport, have lined up a 28-tournament golf season. There will be three international tournaments on the calendar. The Dugmore Trophy will be at Wingate and will be the first of the five qualifiers for the Windhoek Lager. The others are Julius Robinson Trophy, Mawegu Amateur Championship, Masvingo Amateur and Rowland Park Open. The five tournaments will be played in the first half of the year with the final qualifier, the Rowland Park Open, set for May 17-20. Local amateurs will hardly take a break as they will return for the Matabeleland Amateur, which will be the start of the Eisenhower Trophy qualifiers, on May 31. The Chapman Grand Slam will be the second of the five qualifiers. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Amateur Golf teams won the triangular series pitting Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi on Wednesday.
