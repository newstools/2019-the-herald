The Herald RIYADH. – Anthony Joshua says he chose to “reinvent” himself after defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr and feels “different” going into Saturday’s world heavyweight boxing rematch. Joshua, who lost his three world heavyweight titles to Ruiz on June 1, says he has decided to “check” his approach after a first defeat. “There is fire in the belly,” the Briton told BBC Sport in Saudi Arabia before the fight at the Diriyah Arena.
“There are things I have had to do to take me to the next level. “I am confident I can be victorious and when I am I will tell everyone of how I went wrong.” Rumours circulated about Joshua’s condition in the wake of his shock defeat by Ruiz at Madison Square Garden. Word from his camp is that he has delivered some of the most impressive sparring of his career in recent days.
There is also a feeling that the additional sparring partners he has used – including Mexican Elvis Garcia to offer some stylistic similarities to Ruiz – have raised his level. After speaking to BBC Sport a short drive from the hotel complex where both he and Ruiz are staying, the former champion was scheduled to work out for the second time on Monday at his training base, the British Embassy in Riyadh. He is holding a number of late-night sessions in order to be ready for a fight that will take place around midnight local time, given the country is three hours ahead of the UK. “I do feel different,” Joshua (30) added. “I feel confident, I believe. I have been boxing since 2008. It’s almost like it’s been given to me. Now I am back to the days of being younger, striving. “The question I have to ask myself is, ‘after the fight am I going to keep that same attitude?’ I have to stick to it and that is what will take me on to the next level. “I am a challenger. This is my chance at the heavyweight championship of the world. The event starts when I am victorious. Then I will tell you about my story, what I have come through, the obstacles.” — BBC Sport.
