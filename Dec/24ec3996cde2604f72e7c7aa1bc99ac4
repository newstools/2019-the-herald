As the countdown to Christmas continues, lights and decorations showing the festive mood are glittering in homes and public places. Africa Unity Square in the city centre is now sparkling, with colourful lights that are up on trees and poles in the park as an annual tradition. Many shops in the CBD are competing to display the best decorations to announce the coming of the merry-making season. In the western end of Harare, Christmas lights will be switched on at Westgate Shopping Mall today. It is also an annual event that has attracted attention of many shoppers and residents in the area. As usual, the event will be spiced up with some entertainment and Alexio Kawara will be part of the celebrations. He will perform at La Rouge at the shopping mall. The musician said he was happy to be part of the celebrations to light up the festive season. “The festive season is upon us and there are many signs of merry-making in decorations and lights around us,” said Alexio. “Westgate traditionally holds its switch-on ceremony this time of the year and it is an honour to celebrate with people from the area and visitors that will come to embrace the festive spirit. We have a playlist of songs that will invoke the merrymaking spirit.”
