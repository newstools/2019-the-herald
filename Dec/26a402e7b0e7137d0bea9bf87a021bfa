The Herald DOHA. – Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool are fully focused on winning this week’s Club World Cup ahead of their semi-final against Monterrey of Mexico. But the Reds have hit out at the timing of the competition and questioned FIFA’s plans to expand the tournament in future.
“We are here now and we are completely focused on it, but if you had asked me beforehand if I think that there should be a Club World Cup in the middle of our season, I would say no, in my honest opinion,” Klopp told journalists at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, where Liverpool face Monterrey today. The Anfield club have had to take time out from their seemingly relentless march towards the Premier League title to travel to Qatar for the tournament, in which they are Europe’s representatives thanks to their Champions League triumph last season.
If Liverpool win against the Mexicans, they will advance to a final on Saturday against either Flamengo of Brazil or Saudi side Al Hilal, while even if they lose their semi-final they will remain in Qatar for a third-place play-off at the weekend. Their Premier League trip to West Ham United, scheduled for this weekend, was postponed as a result, and were forced to play their League Cup quarter-final at Aston Villa yesterday with a squad of academy players due to the lack of alternatives in a packed schedule. -AFP.
