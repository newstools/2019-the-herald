The Herald 44th Cabinet Meeting Decisions Matrix: 10th December, 2019
1. Local production of number plates as an import substitution strategy
Following a presentation by the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development on the need to produce number plates locally as an import substitution strategy, Cabinet tasked local innovation hubs to come up with a patent for the local production of number plates with the requisite security features.
Cabinet is confident the move to produce number plates locally will ease the current shortages being experienced in the country due to the limited availability of foreign currency.
The local production of new number plates will also increase the utilisation of the country’s resources, including local scientists, and create employment for citizens. 2. The country’s power and fuel supply situation
Following an update report by the Minister of Energy and Power Development on the country’s power and fuel supply situation, Cabinet noted with concern that although the daily average diesel and petrol uplifts for the past week had increased compared to the previous week, fuel queues continue to be visible.
Consequently, Cabinet reiterated that all service stations caught engaging in illegal activities be identified and perpetrators brought to book through fines and, where appropriate, withdrawal of operating licences. <img class="wp-image-462673 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/849A1494.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/849A1494.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/849A1494-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa addresses the media in the company of Energy and Power Development Minister Fortune Chasi at a post-Cabinet briefing in Harare yesterday. – Picture: Believe Nyakudjara 3.
