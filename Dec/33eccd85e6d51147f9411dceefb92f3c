The Herald ABU DHABI. – Lewis Hamilton laid down a marker to the young pretenders to his crown on Sunday when he completed 2019 with a masterful triumph at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, his 11th win this year and the 84th of his career. The six-times world champion started from his record 88th pole position, was untroubled, led every lap and reeled off a lap record for the Yas Marina circuit on his way to his 50th victory from pole. His race engineer Peter Bonnington told him his performance had been “a master class” as he slowed down before delivering a series of ‘donuts’ to delight the fans. “Honestly I’m proud, definitely, but I’m super-grateful to this incredible team and all the people at Mercedes who have continued to push this year,” said Hamilton. “Who would’ve thought, at the end of the year, we had the strength and we’ve learned, and tried, to extract more out of this beautiful car? I’m so grateful to Team LH! I travel around the world to different countries and I get to see people who inspire me and send me messages that lift me up. “Thank you for watching. Thank you for supporting. I feel so happy today, man.” Asked during an official post-race interview with former driver David Coulthard about the competition in 2020 from Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who finished second, and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who came home third, but faced a post-race investigation into fuel irregularities, Hamilton was generous. — AFP.
