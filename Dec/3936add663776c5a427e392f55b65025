The Herald THE introduction of innovation hubs across the country has started paying dividend as new technologies are being developed to transform the country’s economic landscape with more prospects for job creation. Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development Minister, Prof Amon Murwira, revealed this during a recent University Councils’ Induction Workshop at a Kwekwe hotel. He said the ministry’s “Education 5.0”, was anchored on innovation and industrialisation – replacing ‘traditional design’ education 3.0, whose main focus was on teaching and research. — Bulawayo Bureau.
