THE Champion of Champions event for full-contact styles that was slated for this weekend in Harare has been postponed.
This is meant to allow karatekas time to rest after another event was held last Saturday. The national tournament, which marks the end of the karate season, was this year divided into two events.
The full-contact competition was initially set for this Saturday at Alex Sports Club in Harare while Bulawayo was set to host the semi-contact styles on December 14. Previously, the Champion of Champions was held over a day with full-contact and semi-contact competitions running concurrently at the same venue. But the Zimbabwe Karate Union opted to forego tradition and stage two events in Harare and Bulawayo as part of efforts to grow the sport. ZKU technical director full-contact, Kumbirai Musinami, confirmed the changes.
“The tournament was postponed as full contact had another tournament last week, so athletes need a rest. “We will, through ZKU, advise the new dates for the Champion of Champions.
“We proposed early next year, full-contact is demanding on athletes, so they need a longer rest.
“The tournament last Saturday was under one of the styles. The style events are attended by all the styles,’’ said Musinami.
The event is used for selection of national teams in preparation for the following year’s regional and international competitions. Musinami said the move will not affect their plans for next year since it was done in consultation with the involved stakeholders.
