The Herald Gold eased on Friday as risk appetite improved after US President Donald Trump said trade talks with Beijing were making progress, while markets awaited US jobs data for signs on the health of the US economy. Spot gold was muted at $1 475,90 per ounce as of 1239 GMT, but was set to be up nearly 0,8 percent on the week, marking a second week of gains. US gold futures eased 0,1 percent to $1 480,90 per ounce. “ . . . The hawk money is still definitely in risk assets, which is weighing on gold,” said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler. “If the US non-farm payrolls data comes above expectations, we could probably see further pressure on gold. If it misses expectations, gold could shoot higher; definitely some potential for volatile trading later today (Friday).” European shares edged higher as comments from Trump that trade talks with China were “moving right along” injected some calm into financial markets. — Reuters.
