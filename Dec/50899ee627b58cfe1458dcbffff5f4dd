The Herald Gold prices inched up yesterday as conflicting signals from Washington and Beijing prolonged uncertainty about a trade deal, a day after positive comments on the talks by US President Donald Trump knocked bullion off its one-month high. Gold rose to $1 484 on Wednesday, its highest since November 7, but settled lower after Trump said that trade talks with China were going “very well”. That came a day after Trump dented hopes for a trade resolution when he said an agreement might have to wait until after the US presidential election in November 2020. Spot gold was up 0,1percent at $1 475,58 per ounce, as of 0811 GMT yesterday, and US gold futures         were up 0,1percent at $1 480,90 per ounce. — Reuters.
