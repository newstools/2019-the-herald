DUTCH coach Hendrik Pieter de Jongh has parted ways with Premiership football giants Highlanders. The Dutch coach announced on his Twitter page yesterday that he will not be returning after the festive holidays as he is set to take up “new challenges” elsewhere. De Jongh’s contract with Highlanders is set to expire at the end of the month. “Big thanks to the Bosso family for the cooperation and the great success we had together. Only I go from 1 January 2020 for a new challenges. Thanks for the great time,” he tweeted yesterday. De Jongh inspired Highlanders to a decent sixth place finish in the Castle Lager Premiership after finding the club wallowing in the relegation matrix when he arrived three months ago. The Dutchman superintendented Bosso for 16 official games, winning eight times, drawing six and losing once. Out of the 16 matches, 12 were league games that saw Bosso getting five wins, six draws and a loss, while the other four games were in the Chibuku Super Cup which Bosso won to lift the trophy without conceding a goal. The Chibuku Super Cup victory ended Highlanders’ four-year trophy drought. His success with the giants had endeared him to the club’s supporters, who had hoped to see him continue with the club’s revival next season.
