The Herald Public Service, Labour and  Social Welfare Minister Professor Paul Mavima on Friday announced the  appointment of Arthur Manase as acting general manager for the state  controlled pension fund, the National Social Security Authority (NSSA). Manase, who is an experienced legal practitioner, is a member of the  current NSSA board, which recommended his appointment. He takes over from David Makwara who had been acting GM since last  year, and is reverting back to his role as NSSA director for  investments. “Mr Manase will act in this role until the board completes all  processes that it has so far initiated, which will culminate in the  recruitment of a substantive general manager,” Prof Mavima said. Manase currently serves on the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) board as  well as the Estate Agents Council. NSSA has not had a substantive general manager since April 2018 when  Elizabeth Chitiga was dismissed on allegations of maladministration and  abuse of public funds. — New Ziana.
