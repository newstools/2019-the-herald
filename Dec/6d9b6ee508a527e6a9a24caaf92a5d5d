Preparations for this year’s Miss Tourism Zimbabwe have gathered momentum, with a sashing ceremony slated for tomorrow night at Montclair Hotel and Casino in Juliasdale, Nyanga. Contestants went into boot camp yesterday ahead of the grand finale to be held at the hotel on December 14.
Tomorrow’s sashing ceremony will be a precursor to next week’s final where a national queen will be crowned. Miss Tourism Zimbabwe licence holder Sarah Mpofu said preparations are at an advanced stage. “Models are now in boot camp and we are confident of an exciting final,” she said. “There will be many activities during the week as models prepare for the contest. The sashing ceremony will kick start events of the week and all the models in camp look excited. “It is good that we are holding this year’s Miss Tourism in an area that has many tourist attractions. The girls will visit some sites and learn about the destinations. We hope to take the pageant to other parts of the country in the next editions. We thank our sponsors for making the event possible.” Montclair Hotel and Casino sales and marketing manager Busisiwe Tutani said they partnered Miss Tourism Zimbabwe to promote the pageant that seeks to boost tourism. “The pageant has a good cause,” she said. “We believe the queen will be the face of Zimbabwe tourism and will help market the country’s unique destinations. Nyanga and the Eastern Highlands at large have many tourist attractions. We hope hosting this event will help the pageant achieve some of its goals.” It will be the second time for Montclair to be associated with the pageant after successfully hosting Miss Tourism Manicaland, the provincial leg of the national finals, in July. Provincial finals were held in different parts of the country between June and July to select those who will compete for the national crown.
