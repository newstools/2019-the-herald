The Herald Ford Motor Company and its local franchise holders and distributors — Duly Motors and Croco Motors — donated goodies worth thousands of US dollars to Chinyaradzo Children’s Home as part of  its corporate social responsibility initiative. The initiative is part of Ford’s Global Caring Month (GCM). Ford, Croco Motors and Duly Motors drilled a borehole and donated 48 bunk beds,  two stoves and groceries worth US$10 000. The donation was handed over to Chinyaradzo Children’s Home director of child protection society, Ms Mercy Sakanya by chairman of Croco Holdings Moses Chingwena and a representative from Ford Sub-Saharan Africa, Ms Callinah Mafokane on Thursday. Duly Motors and Croco Motors are the only authorised and official franchise holders for Ford in Zimbabwe. Speaking at the event, Mr Chingwena said Ford, Duly Motors and Croco Motors heard the pleas of Chinyaradzo Children’s Home especially around the need for consistent clean running water at the home. “We all know the water challenges in Harare and the country at large. These have not spared Chinyaradzo Children’s Home. Thousands of Ford employees globally take time to make people’s lives better during the Ford Global Caring Month, reinforcing Ford’s role in partnership with their country distributors as a trusted community partner. Duly Motors and Croco Motors are no exception,” said Mr Chingwena. — Business Reporter.
