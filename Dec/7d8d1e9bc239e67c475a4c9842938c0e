The local fashion sector is struggling to grow due to lack of investors. The sector, which has seen the rise of many new designers and brands that are good enough to compete with international clothing lines, is failing to gain a huge chunk of the market share. The brands lack resources to produce large volumes, set up retail outlets and market their products when competing with imports that are readily accepted by retail giants and local consumers. Rising clothing line Paz and Chivz is one company that has been seeking investments to grow their brand on the continent. Paz and Chivz founder Brendan Pazarangu said his company needed resources to compete with imports. “Since we started our company in 2017, we have been building our brand and reputation,” he said. “Our designs have been well received, but we can do so much more with necessary resources for expansion.”  Paz and Chivz employs two tailors and is able to design and make different clothes ranging from suits to street wear for both men and women. The company operates from a small workshop in Greystone Park, Harare. “We hope to open a shop, expand our product line, with an ultimate goal of being the biggest African fashion powerhouse,” said Paz and Chivz co-founder Takura Chivasa. “To achieve this, we need interested partners to come on board.” To market their products, the company has been dressing local celebrities and socialites, among them Star FM’s DJ Mox and Genius ‘Ginimbi’ Kadungure. They have different brand ambassadors dotted across the globe in countries such as United Kingdom, Poland, Dubai, Mauritius, Qatar and United Arab Emirates. Chivasa urged Zimbabweans to support local brands. “Many people tend to go to Dubai to shop for different occasions because they are not aware of the great quality local designers are producing,” he said. “Supporting local brands will help grow the sector and in return create employment.”
