The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo It is three days before Christmas day. Many have already concluded their plans, while others are finalising schedules. The festive season is the time for joy and happiness, time to be merry with family and friends. <img class="wp-image-464547 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/2012-1-1-TTTT.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/2012-1-1-TTTT.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/2012-1-1-TTTT-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Janet Manyowa (singer) It is time for some to show how fat their pockets are, spending large sums of money on holiday to places like Bahamas, San Antonio, Puebla, Hawaii and Sun City. Others will take time to go with their families on shopping sprees outside the country. Yet others will throng local resort areas where they will have quality time with their families and friends. Some will travel to the rural areas to spend time with their close family members, while others will simply stay put in the city and enjoy the day with various activities. Those in diaspora are already trickling back into the country, with groceries, clothes and furniture from different foreign lands. It is that time of the year again, when those from abroad come to flash their money and spend (sometimes carelessly) with family and friends. The lucky ones will get the 13th cheque from their employers. During this season, stories of wives complaining of husbands that would have spent money with girlfriends are common. How then are you spending your Christmas and how has been 2019? The Herald on Saturday Lifestyle talked to known personalities from various disciplines about their Christmas plans and experiences of the year. Mambo Dhuterere (Musician) “We just wish everyone a blessed festive season. 2019 was a year of breakthrough and I can testify that with my music managing to penetrate the market. I will be releasing more music next year and I thank God for making me a superstar. I am still trying to cope up with the pressures of being a celebrity.” Mr Cho Jaichel (Korean ambassador to Zimbabwe) “I am not going home to Korea where the rest of my family is. I will be around alone and I want to finish my book that I am writing about my experiences in Zimbabwe. That will be my Christmas. “The book will have stories on arts and culture, especially my encounter with Alick Macheso and Jah Prayzah, the events that I have been attending and I will write suggestive solutions and proposals on how best we can help the industry and joining Korea and Zimbabwe. “In fact, it is not new spending the holidays alone as the last time I was in my country on Christmas was seven years ago.” Vanessa Chiyangwa-Chironga (Interior designer) “We hope to host some family and friends with our private chef who will create cuisines from scratch, that we hope we can start making a tradition for our children for years to come. “Sadly, my year started off extremely rough. I got into a car accident early January just after schools opened. My car overturned four times. I was wheelchair-bound and had neck cast for three months, but thank God for 2019.” Reverend Togarepi Chivaviro (Gospel music singer) “I will be with my family in South Africa relaxing and will also do some charity work. This is the most precious time with my family. I hardly have that time as I will always be at church ministering the word of God. My highest point for 2019 was when my son joined my industry and he managed to record his album. The sad part of this year was when we lost our icon, the legend Dr Oliver Mtukudzi.” Tafadzwa Chitsa (Events planner) “Christmas is a time for family. We are planning to do a get-together with our family members at home. We are not travelling though. 2019 has been an amazing year despite the economic challenges. My job is people-centred as we work to provide flawless events. Just seeing the smile on our clients’ faces is priceless.” Lucky Aaroni (Film-maker) “Christmas time is family time. We are planning to visit our relative for meals. We won’t be at our homestead, but this is the time for us to cherish and meet those I last saw in ages. (toda kunokwata 7am to 7pm). We would like to party and later we go for braai.” Felistas “Mai Titi” Edwards (Comedian) “This Christmas, I am celebrating with 150 orphans and my soccer team. It is starting this Sunday. I am going to slaughter a beast for them. Then on Monday, I will be flying to Dubai, alone for the holidays. I can say 2019 was a blessed year for me. The greatest highlight for me is that I managed to buy a house.” Pauline Likongwe Mapisa (Wedding expert) “For me the festive season means more work. I will be in Chegutu and Chinhoyi at weddings. I will try to see how best I can make it to both places. The highest point for 2019 was being nominated thrice at the inaugural Zim Weddings Awards.” Janet Manyowa (Gospel music singer) “It will be work each day this festive season. For us musicians we don’t have rest until after New Year.
I can say my highs for 2019 were dominating at this year’s awards such as those for Star FM, Permican and NAMA, not forgetting the release of my audio and video of “Ndimi”. Hardlife Zvirekwi (Soccer player) “Definitely, I will be going to my rural home in Mutare. I need quality time with my family after a long season of football. We were in the race for the Premier Soccer League championship this year and, unfortunately, we lost it on the last day of the season.”
