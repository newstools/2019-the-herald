FC Platinum set themselves on the cusp of retaining the Premiership title for the third season in a row after they beat Black Rhinos to climb to the summit of the log. Devon Chafa scored from the penalty spot to earn the maximum points for Lizwe Swesweâ€™s team. With CAPS United losing 2-3 to Ngezi Platinum at Baobab Stadium, FC Platinum are now a point clear with just a game before the season ends on Saturday. Interestingly, FC Platinum face CAPS United in the last game of the season at the National Sports Stadium on Saturday.
