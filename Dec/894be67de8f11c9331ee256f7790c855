The Herald LONDON. — Mikel Arteta has agreed to become the next manager of Arsenal with the English Premiership football club hoping he will be in charge for Saturday’s trip to Everton. And Arsene Wenger has warned that Arteta’s lack of experience means he will need to surround himself with the right people if he is to succeed as Arsenal’s new head coach. Arteta is expected to be named as the permanent successor to Unai Emery, who was sacked last month, with Freddie Ljungberg’s spell as interim boss having largely failed to improve results. After spending the final five years of his playing career under Wenger’s management at Arsenal, Arteta became an assistant coach to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, where he has been part of two English Premier League-winning campaigns. Wenger has suggested that Arsenal have moved away from the “special values” he installed at the club and has criticised recent signings, warning Arteta that he must correct those two key areas when he takes over. The Spanish coach, who is primed to leave Manchester City for the Emirates, walks into a club in chaos, with the Gunners having won just once in their last 14 outings in all competitions and sitting as close to the relegation zone as the top four. — The Mirror.
