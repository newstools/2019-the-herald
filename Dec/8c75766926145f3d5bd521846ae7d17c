The Zimbabwe team for the Africa Youth Chess Championship has received a boost from local food processing and manufacturing company Vamara Group. The team, which comprises 12-year old Natasha Choko, Ruramai Tapambwa (10), Grace Zvarebwa (8) and Lynne Chidanire (8), is expected to leave for the tournament this weekend. The Africa Youth Chess Championship will run from tomorrow until December 22 in Windhoek, Namibia. Well-wishers have managed to raise $US5 500 from a budget of $6 500. Varama also chipped in with food hampers through their Sunrise brand. If they excel in Namibia, the girls have a chance to go and represent the nation the World Youth Chess Championship to be held in Romania next year.
