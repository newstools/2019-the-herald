The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter VETERAN golf instructor, David Leadbetter, is expected to open an academy in Zimbabwe early next year. The world-renowned coach, originally from Worthing in Sussex, England, grew up and played junior golf in Zimbabwe. He then became the apprentice professional at Royal Harare as he took his fledgling steps in golf instruction. Leadbetter is credited with playing a pivotal role in 26 Major victories and supported seven players to become the world number one. These include his Zimbabwean friend, Nick Price, who claimed three Major titles, including the British Open Championship, during the 1990s. The Leadbetter Academy will be opened early 2020 at his old stomping ground at Royal Harare. The new Harare-based academy will be the second one in Africa for Leaderbetter after the other one in Agadir, Morocco. The local academy will have Ryan Cairns, a Zimbabwean Sunshine Tour winner with more than 300 tournaments under his belt in a 15-year playing career, as its director and on-course performance instructor. He will be supported by Robson Saurombe, Roy Da Costa, Terry Cairns and Sean Bell to cover all the aspects of coaching with each offering expertise in their specialist fields. “It is really exciting for me to open an academy at a location that I know very well from my junior days. “We know how many great players have come out of Zimbabwe in the past and I’m looking forward to helping produce great players in the future. “It is a real thrill for me to return to my roots and I can’t wait to visit what is going to be my second academy on the African continent,” said Leadbetter.
