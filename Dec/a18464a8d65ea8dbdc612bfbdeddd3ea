The Herald Eskom, South Africa’s biggest polluter, has asked for additional emission exemptions at two of its biggest plants, a request that will increase environmental protests against the state-owned utility at a time when it’s already being slammed for rolling power cuts. Eskom, which is struggling to meets its costs and has R454bn in debt, has applied to the environment ministry to delay complying with sulphur dioxide emission limits at its Medupi coal-fired plant by five years. It’s also seeking permission not to install emission reduction equipment at its Matimba plant at all, saying it’s not cost-effective.  Emissions of particulate matter, which cause respiratory disease, are already at a 20-year high since equipment at the utility’s Kendal plant was damaged during a strike. — Fin 24.
