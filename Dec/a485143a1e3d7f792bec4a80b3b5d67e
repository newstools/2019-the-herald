The Herald LONDON. – Brendan Rodgers has opened the door to Arsenal after admitting there is a clause in his contract allowing him to leave if a big offer came in for him. Rodgers is among the top targets for the Gunners as they search for a replacement for Unai Emery who was sacked last week. And the Leicester manager confirmed that there is something written into his deal with the club which could see him leave to take up another job. After his side secured a dramatic late win over Everton to stay second in the Premier League, Rodgers said: “Listen, there are probably clauses in most managers’ contracts. “It’s all hypothetical. We got a brilliant win. We came back very well. “I made a change eight, nine months ago. I feel so happy. We still have a lot of work to do. “I’ve been very fortunate to work with some brilliant clubs and great institutions. The ambition was to help the club to arrive in the top six.” It is thought Leicester would demand in the region of £14million compensation from any club hoping to snatch their manager. The Foxes would fight as hard as possible to keep hold of the 46-year-old, who they snatched from Celtic last season. They would also try to persuade their manager that with the Foxes currently well placed in the table, there is a greater prospect of playing Champions League football next season if he stays put. — The Sun.
