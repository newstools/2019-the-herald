The Herald PARIS. — Euronext wheat futures edged lower on Wednesday as a pullback in Chicago encouraged the Paris market to consolidate below a two-week high struck earlier this week.
Physical premiums in western Europe were steady, however, with support from export demand and logistical difficulties linked to strikes in France over pension reform.
March milling wheat, the most active contract on the Paris-based Euronext exchange, settled down 0,75 euro or 0,4percent at 185,25 euros ($204.18) a tonne.
The contract had reached 187,00 euros on Monday, its highest since December 2 when that level had marked a 4-1/2 month peak. — Reuters.
