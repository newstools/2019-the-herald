The Herald Gold prices yesterday hovered near a one-week high hit in the previous session, as the dollar nursed its steepest losses in weeks after the US Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates and signalled moderate economic growth for next year. Spot gold was largely unchanged at $1 474 per ounce, by 0217 GMT. In the previous session, the bullion hit $1 478, its highest since December 5. US gold futures were up 0,3 percent at $1 479,10. Gold prices gained 1 percent on Wednesday, after the Fed held interest rates steady and signalled borrowing costs will not change anytime soon, with moderate economic growth and historically low unemployment expected to persist through the 2020 presidential election. â€” Reuters.
