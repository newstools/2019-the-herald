The Herald A FINE opening partnership of 88 between Kudzai Maunze and Chamu Chibhabha put Eagles on the way to taking a powerful grip on their Logan Cup match against Rhinos on the second day at Harare Sports Club yesterday. This came after their bowlers had dismissed the Kwekwe-based team for 118, and they finished the day in a very powerful position at 249 for five wickets, having more than doubled their opponents’ score. Rhinos resumed in the morning at 48 for four wickets, with Neville Madziva on 11 and Tendai Chisoro on two.
Throughout the morning session it was a steady progression towards an all-out total of 118 at the lunch interval. Chisoro stayed quite a while to score five, and then, when he did attempt a big hit, he skyed a catch to mid-off from the bowling Blessing Muzarabani. Madziva played well for his 34, the highest score on his side before being trapped lbw to Faraz Akram at 95 for six wickets.
He also shared the biggest partnership of the innings, 35 for the sixth wicket with Bright Matsiwe, who was making his début as a wicket-keeper for Rhinos. The tail had little to contribute, and Matsiwe finished with 27 not out, an impressive innings for his fighting spirit and determination that lasted two-and-a-quarter hours. Bright Njanji had scored 15 on the first day and only these three of the Rhinos team reached double figures.
Muzarabani, with three wickets for 27 runs off 14 overs, made a good return to Zimbabwe domestic cricket, though he did bowl a number of wild deliveries. There were two wickets each for Richard Ngarava and Akram, whose best delivery was a fast yorker that skittled Brandon Mavuta first ball, knocking out two stumps. Scores
