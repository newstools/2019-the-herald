The Herald Mbira star Hope Masike has joined hands with Zambian musician, Mumba Yachi, on their upcoming track titled “Pauri”.
The two said this is their first project together and they decided to start by creating a love song for their audiences.
Masike said the song has a mixture of four African languages, which is a celebration of the African culture. “In the song, we celebrate the importance of love and how it needs to be watered in order to grow,” she said. “This is a serious love song for our mature audiences. Since it’s a love song, we are going to be releasing it next year on Valentine’s Day. “We sang ‘Pauri’ in four languages, which include Swahili, Bemba, Shona and Ndebele as a way to celebrate our cultures. I will be travelling to Zambia soon for the video shoot.” Masike expressed gratitude in collaborating with Yachi, saying this was a great start since there were a few collaborations in their genre of music. “Let this be a seed so that we witness more collaborations between the two countries,” she said.
Yachi, who arrived in the country last Monday with his manager Mwila Mutale, said Zimbabwe was his first stop in his African-Media Tour. “After releasing my sixth album dubbed “Great Work Volume 2” last month, that’s when l decided to move around the continent because it is my responsibility to spread Zambian music in Africa,” he said. “Zimbabwe is a great country with people who love and produce great quality of music, that’s why it was my first stop.
“I remember when the late music legend Dr Oliver Mtukudzi used to come to Zambia to perform. The venues were always packed because his music was priceless and Zambians are still waiting to see who will take after Mtukudzi.” Yachi said he had the opportunity to meet the local producers and musicians who include Willis Wataffi, Blessing Chimanga and Tariro Negitare.
