THE Champion of Champions matches pitting newly-promoted Premiership clubs are hanging by a thread after it emerged some teams are in the dark about the tournament. It is scheduled for this weekend at Mucheke in Masvingo. Bulawayo City, Whawha, Cranborne Bullets and Tenax are expected to battle it out for top honours. The tournament is organised by ZIFA. After the draw held in Masvingo at the weekend, Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera’s Cranborne Bullets will meet Luke “Jukulile” Petros’ Whawha. Try Ncube’s Bulawayo City will face Blessing Madhombi’s Tenax on Saturday while the winners will meet in the final on Sunday. Club representatives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said their participation in the tournament was in doubt. They said their players are already on holiday. “I don’t think we will be able to fulfil those fixtures as we last played competitive matches some five weeks ago,’’ said one of the officials. “I don’t think it will be professional to recall players who are already on an off-season to come and play without training. “Most of the league games were last played three weeks ago and most players are on holiday and to make them regroup is very difficult. “There is no way the players can come in for a few days and then we travel to Masvingo for the matches. Martin Kweza, the ZIFA Northern Region acting chairman, told our sister paper Sunday News that they were going ahead with the tournament in Masvingo, with or without a sponsor.
