Less-privileged artistes will have a chance to showcase their talents at 7 Arts Theatre in Harare at the launch of a DVD titled “Open Heavens” tomorrow. The event is being organised by the Cherubim and Serafin Foundation together with the IAM Choir. Talented upcoming artistes from local orphanages have been invited to the event, which will double as a Christmas celebration concert. In an interview,Nehemiah Chipato, who is one of the organisers, said the occasion is meant to help groom less priviledged but talented  individuals who have passion for art. “Our vision is to create an uncensored artistic society through eradication of social ills and promoting marginalised groups. ‘‘We want to create unique artworks and platforms that redress fragility, inequality and poverty by discovering raw talent among the less privileged’’. “We are after empowering talents by heightening awareness of their rights and responsibilities to enhance their self-confidence and enable them to improve their lives,” he said. Chipato said admission is free. Several gospel artists from the popular gospel choir Zimpraise are expected to entertain the audience. “Faith Mafunda, Nyasha Mutonhori and Ellard Chererai will grace the event as performers on Friday. “We have also invited orphanages to come as we will be celebrating Christmas. This is the giving season so the foundation will give out grocery hampers to the less privileged.” The Cherubim and Serafin Foundation is a non-profit organisation, which was formed by Prophet Lucky Cherubim and Prophetess Martina Cherubim. The founders believe that being homeless, disabled, or being in the rural areas does mean that one is not talented.
