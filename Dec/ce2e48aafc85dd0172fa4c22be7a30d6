IN a bid to improve the country’s sport sector, efforts are underway to implement the prioritisation of sport codes for improved performances and better results. The prioritisation of sport codes is likely to lead to a focused approach, in terms of support towards development and producing results.  It will also increase the level of competitiveness and performances by the local teams and athletes at various levels. Sports Commission director-general, Prince Mupazviriho, said the process has begun with national associations submitting their 10-year-development plans, which will guide them on the sport codes to be prioritised. “We are currently doing our assessment because we have requested every national association to give us their 10-year development plan and the cut-off date for that is tomorrow (today).” “And, it is going to inform us in terms of the level of development for each sport code and we then look at the competitive advantages we have vis-a-vis whether they are getting some investment from their international federations or not.” “That will then inform us where we need to put our attention on. And, we are talking of our attention in terms of what is it that we need to do.” “Let’s say, in the next four years, we want to go and compete at a certain level and be able to win medals . . . so that’s what we are doing,’’ said Mupazviriho. He noted that they would also look at various levels of competition and what they offer. “We will then also look at which are the sport codes which are also played at regional, at continental and at international level,’’ he said. “Where we have got strength as a country, both in terms of the existing infrastructure, the existing expertise and in terms of coaching and everything else.” “That will then inform us how we are going to select the prioritisation.’’ The Sports Commission director-general said they were hoping to start implementing the programme next year.
