The Herald Gold prices inched up yesterday after the US House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump on articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Spot gold was up 0,1percent at $1,477.15 per ounce, as of 0152 GMT. US gold futures were up 0,2percent at $1,481.30 per ounce. Trump became the third US president to be impeached as the House formally charged him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in a historic step that will inflame partisan tensions across a deeply divided America.  The House action sets the stage for a trial next month in the Republican-controlled Senate on whether to convict him and remove him from office. — Reuters.
