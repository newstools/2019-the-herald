The Herald Bakers Inn, a subsidiary of Inscor Africa Limited, last week donated farming supplies and machinery worth $220,551 to the Jairos Jiri Association ahead of the 2019/20 farming season as part of its “I Am Bakers Inn’’ corporate social responsibility. The donation includes a drip irrigation kit, generator, hoes, wheelbarrows, shovels, harrows, spades, picks, seeds, fertilisers and a water tank. Bakers Inn chief executive officer Ngoni Mazango said his company recognised the need at the Jairos Jiri centre which acquired a farm in Budiriro 4, Harare, but could not develop the land due to lack of funding. “Jairos Jiri Association secured land measuring 6,89 hectares in Budiriro 4 called Gleneagles Farm which it intends to use for income generating projects. However, the land was underutilised due to lack of funding and as Bakers Inn, we decided to lend a helping hand through availing farming equipment and supplies,” Mr Mazango said. He added that they also recruited over 100 Bakers Inn staff volunteers who will work with Jairos Jiri Association from December 2019 to October 2020 to deliver food and livelihood sustainability as well as impact life skills to people with disability. — Business Reporter.
