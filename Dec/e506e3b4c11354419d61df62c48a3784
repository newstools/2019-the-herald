BORROWDALE Racecourse will host the last race meeting of 2019 with two feature races tomorrow afternoon.
To close the long year will be race eight, the 1600m Tote Free Handicap for three-year-olds, and the $100 000 Gold Cup Sprint over 1800m. The Gold Cup Sprint will have seasoned runners like Cochella who will come in as an outsider as she is giving too much weight of 63kgs. The winner might be expected to come from the light weights, Coastal Torrent or Silver Coin.
Of the two, the latter seems to be more consistent in its recent time predictions â€“ twice calculated at under 68 seconds for the 1200 metres. The minor places will be fought out by top weight Coachella, Fareeq and What a Dandy
While Coachella is the real class horse in the field, 63 kgs is a lot of pudding to carry in any event, but if the going is soft, Coachella may be found wanting. The other race to look forward to is race four on the day, which will be the 2400m Merit Rated 75 Handicap due off at 13:55 pm. The eight carded runners include some of our top stayers as well as a couple of first timers over this trip.
