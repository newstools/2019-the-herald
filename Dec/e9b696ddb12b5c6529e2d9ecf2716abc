The Herald MANCHESTER. — In the wake of Manchester United’s 2-1 victory over local football rivals Manchester City, Harry Maguire has set his sights on the top four of the English Premiership. A week that started with scrutiny and mounting pressure on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ended with a second memorable victory in a matter of days. Fresh from deservedly seeing off Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham 2-1 on Wednesday evening, United won by the same scoreline across town at the Etihad Stadium thanks to a roaring start and impressive game plan. Few connected to City could have complained had Solskjaer’s side added two goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial in a fine first half that laid the foundation for a victory that secured more than just bragging rights. The 2-1 win in the 179th Manchester derby moved United up to fifth and within five points of the Champions League spots after fourth-placed Chelsea fell to a surprise loss at embattled Everton.
“I think you need to look after your own results, don’t look elsewhere, keep winning games,” Maguire, the world’s most expensive defender, said. — AFP.
