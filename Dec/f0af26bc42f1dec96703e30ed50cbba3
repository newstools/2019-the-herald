The Herald The Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory  Authority (Zera) yesterday announced the reduction in the level of  petrol blending with ethanol on the market by 10 percentage points to E10. The reduction, which is with immediate effect, takes the blending levels down from E20, a move likely to be welcomed by motorists. As the names imply, ethanol fuel mixtures have “E” numbers which describe the percentage of ethanol fuel in the mixture by volume. “Please be advised that the level on blending of anhydrous ethanol with unleaded petrol has been reduced from E20 to E10,” Zera said in a statement. “Implementation is with immediate effect.” — New Ziana.
