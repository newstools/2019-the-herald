PRIMARY and Secondary Education Minister Professor Paul Mavima has warned incompetent school heads who are not yet aligned to the New Dispensation’s vision 2030 of modernising the education systems, that they risk being censured. The call comes after some high school pupils in Harare such as Allan Wilson Boys High, Mabelreign Girls High, Hatfield Girls High and Craneborne Boys High Schools demonstrated against the school authorities for maladministration. Prof Mavima said they have heard the concerns of the pupils and most of the complaints raised are genuine and action will definitely be taken against the errant headmasters who are failing to run those schools. “In all cases, the demonstration was directed at school administrations. Each school had its own draft of issues to be addressed. “Some were demanding more investment in teaching and learning materials and some were saying they want better equipment in their technology areas.”
