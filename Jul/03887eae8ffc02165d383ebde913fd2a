MIGHTY Warriors coach, Sithetheliwe “Kwinji 15” Sibanda, is bullish the senior women’s national football team will do well at this year’s COSAFA Women Championships. The regional tournament begins tomorrow in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, with an opening match between Zimbabwe and Angola at Nelson Mandela Bay. The senior team and the Young Mighty Warriors left yesterday for South Africa. “We want to do better than we did last year. A lot of development is going on in women’s football and you can see that we are no longer experiencing high scores like before meaning there are no longer any small teams. “So, we have to apply our tactics well, starting with the match against Angola on Wednesday. “The training sessions that we had, the players showed great response. They looked sharp. I am sure we will compete well,” said Sibanda. Sibanda welcomed Mighty Warriors striker Rudo Neshamba and former skipper Onai Chingawo back into the squad.
