The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is confident that his side will improve after Sunday’s defeat to Napoli, insisting that the Merseysiders will be a “different animal” once the new football season season kicks off. A 3-0 loss in Edinburgh was not ideal for the Reds a week ahead of the Community Shield, with their display completely lacking in attacking thrust. The defeat to the Italian Serie A side makes it four successive pre-season games without a win for the Reds — but Klopp is refusing to panic. Indeed, he was anticipating a difficult summer in terms of preparation for the new campaign, due to the late returns of several key stars. After the game, he said: “I knew before we started that it would be exceptionally difficult because of the situation. We have to adapt to a few things, and we have to create a specific spirit. For this, we have a week’s time. “For the first time since the Champions League final we have 99 per cent of the squad tomorrow (yesterday), only Sadio is missing then, and that’s the moment where we really start talking and preparing a couple of things and then we have to go again. “That you lose players during a pre-season, we are used to — that happened from time to time. ”— AFP.
