The inaugural Zimntulikazi Festival slated for next Saturday is set to rock Harare with a star-studded line-up, the organisers have said. Leading radio station Star FM has announced an expanded list of entertainers to showcase the best of Zimbabwe’s music. “We are pleased to announce the addition of Jah Prayzah, Tammy as well as Tocky Vibes and Ex-Q onto the already stellar line-up of Winky D, Hope Masike, Mannex Motsi, Mathias Mhere and Enzo Ishall,” said a spokesperson for the organisers. The festival, a culmination of the radio station’s month-long, on-air celebration of home-grown music, is the first such event to be hosted by any radio station in Zimbabwe. Zimpapers Radio Broadcasting general manager Mr Comfort Mbofana expressed satisfaction with the preparations. “A lot of back-end work has been done to give the people who will attend the festival a memorable experience as they enjoy the best of home-grown talent and we expect a fun-filled family day for all,” he said. He added: “As the Zimpapers Radio Broadcasting Division, we are pleased that nationally mandated radio station Star FM — one of the four radio assets in our portfolio — has again demonstrated its support for local artistes especially after the highly successful Star FM Music Awards held earlier this year”. The festival kicks off at 12 noon, and as it is a family-oriented event, it is expected to end by 10pm.
