DESPITE mentoring a number of musicians over many decades, “Senior Lecturer” Nicholas Zakaria’s   passion to support young artistes shows no signs of waning. Recently, he assisted Dhinhidza Express on their latest album which is expected to be launched today in the capital. Madzibaba, as Zakaria is affectionately known, is tonight expected to lead events when the Batsirai Chinyanga-led band launches its album titled “Zvoto Zvinemazera” at City Sports Bar. “It is a good thing to work with musicians like Madzibaba, who has shown his commitment in working with me on this album,” he said. “Madzibaba has also indicated that he will grace our album launch where a number of musicians will also attend. “This is our fourth album after we released ‘Ngoma Yedinhidza’, ‘Chikuru Rudo’ and ‘Nyanga Yedinhidza’,. Chinyanga, who is young brother to the late Studio 263 actor, Nevernay Chinyanga, said other musicians to grace the launch are Paradzai Mesi, Simon Mutambi, Romeo Gasa and Mark Ngwazi. “I believe that our latest album will mark our presence on the music scene. We put in a lot of hard work to give our fans the best. We want to give people value for their money,” he said. Chinyanga said his album talks about respect and encourages people to appreciate their roles and responsibilities within the society.
