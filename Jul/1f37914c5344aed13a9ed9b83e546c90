Zanu-PF will convene the 331th Ordinary Session of the Politburo today at the party headquarters. The party’s secretary for Information and Publicity Cde Simon Khaya Moyo confirmed the meeting in a statement yesterday. “The secretary for Administration Cde Obert Mpofu wishes to advise all members that there shall be a Politburo meeting to be held on Wednesday 24 July 2019 at the party headquarters commencing 1000 hours,” he said. “All members should be seated by 0945 hours sharp.” The Politburo meeting comes after Zanu-PF snatched a ward from the MDC-Alliance in Nyanga and retained another in Bikita by considerable margins, underlying the ruling party’s dominance in local politics. The revolutionary party won the Nyanga’s Ward 26 seat from MDC-Alliance, which had won it in last year’s harmonised polls. Zanu-PF candidate Cde Bisset Mapeta won the poll with 397 votes against MDC-Alliance candidate Mr Vincent Bopoto’s 236. In Bikita’s Ward 31, Zanu-PF candidate Cde Thomas Matanga garnered 1 112 votes against Mr Moses Maphosa of MDC-Alliance’s 410 votes, while Mr Peter Mavenga of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA) came third with a paltry 23 votes. The party is drumming up support ahead of the coming by-elections scheduled for Lupane East, Glen View South, Mangwe and Zaka East National Assembly constituencies. The constituencies fell vacant following the deaths of the incumbents. President Mnangagwa has, in terms of Section 39(2) of the Electoral Act (Chapter 2:13), proclaimed September 7, 2019 as the date for National Assembly by-elections for Glen View South and Mangwe constituencies.
