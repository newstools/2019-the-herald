AFTER years of waiting, Mashonaland Central fans will see the domestic Premiership returning to their doorsteps this weekend when Mushowani finally get to play before their home fans. They host Herentals at Trojan in Bindura on Sunday. Since Mwana Africa’s relegation in 2007, and their subsequent demise, no other team from the province has managed to secure promotion into the elite league. Mwana Africa turned themselves into the toast of the province after winning the CBZ Cup, then the premier knock-out football tournament in the country in their debut season, beating Chapungu 1-0 in the final at Rufaro. Benjamin Marere scored the priceless goal. The Bindura nickel miners, under the guidance of the late Highlanders and Warriors’ legend Willard Mashinkila-Khumalo, then went on an impressive run in the CAF Confederation Cup, the following year. They reached the penultimate stage, before the group phase, where the might of Congolese giants TP Mazembe stopped them. There is a great of optimism among the Mushowani fans that their team can now evoke the spirit of Mwana Africa. Mushowani had been using the National Sports Stadium which they have been sharing with Herentals, CAPS United and Black Rhinos. Their coach Newman Mashipe is relieved that his charges will finally enjoy home advantage and that should see them playing with greater consistency and collecting points.
