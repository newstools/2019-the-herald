The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter CAM and Motor Golf Club will host the inaugural The St James the Greater Parish fundraising golf tournament with more than 20 teams expected to take part. Golf committee chairperson, Kupakwashe Gumbanjera, said they will hold the tournament to raise funds to build a church in Chakari. “We expect the tournament to attract several corporates and individuals as we seek to raise funds to upgrade the St Johns Parish. ‘’People at the half-way, along the Chakari Highway, are currently using a makeshift church so we need to raise funds and build a proper church. “Registration will be done on the day and the tournament will tee off at 8:30 am. “The church needs support for its sustainability hence the fundraising golf event. Companies can participate as teams or individuals and the format will be individual stable-ford four-ball-better-ball. “There are several things on offer like corporate sponsorship of a hole as well as individual sponsorship. “If you are unable to play or sponsor a hole or a prize, we request that your company contribute a goodwill donation to the event,” said Gumbanjera.
