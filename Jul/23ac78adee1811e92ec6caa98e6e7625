TICKETS for the première of a multi-racial movie “The Lord of Kush” set for this month-end at the Theatre in the Park have already sold out, event organisers say. In an interview, producer and co-director, Tendai Maduwa, said he was humbled by a massive response from film enthusiasts. “Our cinema venue can only house 500 people and tickets equivalent to that number have been sold so far,” he said. “We are overwhelmed by people’s response towards this project and we are really humbled by such a gesture.” The 94-minute feature movie stars local actors Lazurus Boora, poet Albert Nyati, Tinopona Katsande and Stella January. It also features South African actress Thandile Sotomela and Zambian actress Nancy Handabile. Maduwa said the movie would be screened in some of Harare’s suburbs soon after the première before embarking on a national tour. “However, to those that came a bit late to purchase tickets they can wait for the next screening which are organising for August,” he said. Maduwa said the movie was inspired by true life events of the Peshawar School Massacre which took place in Pakistan. “I was in Pakistan years ago and there was a school (Peshawar) that was bombed by terrorists leading to the death of innocent children,” he said. “This  incident motivated me to pen this film. The movie tackles issues to do with peace, tolerance and just living together as a people regardless of religious, political, racial or tribal differences.” In the movie a retired professor imposes Christianity to Islamic kids triggering reactions that led to the bombings and other events that later unfolded.
