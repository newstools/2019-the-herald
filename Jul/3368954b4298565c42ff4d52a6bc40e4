HAVE you been living in shame and being haunted by the pain that comes with it or you have been failing to find solutions to your failing businesses? Reverend Chris Oparaocha could have found the answers in his two books titled “Your Time to Come Out of Shame and Pain” and “Understanding Business 101” which are set to be launched on Tuesday at Prince Edward School in Harare. Dr Noah Pashapa will be the guest of honour at an event where musician Dereck Mpofu and stand-up comedian, Kiri, are expected to entertain guests. Rev Chris said he was expecting to release two more books before the end of year. “These are my first books and I have written four books. The other ones will be released at the end of this year,” he said. Rev Chris said “Your time to Come Out of Shame and Pain” was inspired by the daily challenges that people went through in life. He also attempted to unlock some of the steps one can take to come out of shame and the pains that comes with it. In the same book, Rev Chris has also penned a chapter called “No begging and Let My People Go” where he talks of self sustainability. “Understanding Business 101” was inspired by the need for people in the community, especially in the church, to think of maximally utilising resources at their disposal. “Most people dream of running a successful and flourishing business. They desire to get rich through business but seem not to know where to start from to achieve this vision,” he said. Rev Chris said he took time to study the markets and business world for him to come up with ideas that could be easily applied on every business level. In his book, Rev Chris has carefully penned chapters that dwells on how to raise capital and explain why businesses fail. He also included another chapter tipping on how to survive in a harsh economic environment. “It is time to stop thinking like an employee and start thinking like an employer,” he said.
