ZIMBABWEAN football supporters based in South Africa got a huge boost yesterday when COSAFA announced that fans will have free entry into the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium for the COSAFA Women’s Championships. The tournament runs from July 31 up to August 11 in Port Elizabeth. The Mighty Warriors and the Young Mighty Warriors will be competing at the annual regional tournament. The senior teams’ matches will mostly be at Wolfson Stadium, while the inaugural COSAFA Women’s Under-20 Championships games will be at Gelvandale Stadium. Fans wishing to take advantage of this opportunity, to watch the matches for free, can collect their free tickets from Spar Daku, Spar New Brighton, Spar Zonke (Motherwell), U Save, Opposite Wolfson Stadium, Spar Gelvandale, Spar Espen Heights, Spar Algoa and Spar Algoa Foods in the Nelson Mandela Bay area. The Mighty Warriors began camp on Wednesday and are expected to leave early next week. Their first match is on Wednesday while the Under-20 team begin their inaugural Under-20 Championship with an opening match against the hosts South Africa on August 1. Mighty Warriors skipper, Talent Mandaza, believes they gained a lot from playing competitive football in their league matches. The Black Rhinos Queens midfielder missed last year’s tournament in Port Elizabeth as she was attending an army course. “I don’t really know what happened last year but that is water under the bridge and we are looking at advancing from our group and the rest will be easier for us,’’ she said.
