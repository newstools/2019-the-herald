FORMER Chevrons bowler Garry Brent, who is the head coach at Alistair Campbell cricket academy, said they are happy to partner Dubai Dessert Cubs cricket academy who have been in the country on a two-week tour. The visitors left yesterday. They played several matches against different Harare Select teams. A total of four teams ranging from Under-11, Under-13 and Under-14 sides played, at least seven matches each at Old Georgians, Harare Sports Club and Alex Sports Club during the tour. “We are happy to be among the guys who have shared some notes with the visiting Dubai Desert Cubs and it helped a lot. “Our aim is to promote sports tourism and I think this will go a long way in supporting the nation at large. “There is a lot of potential and the interest shown by the parents was encouraging and we hope it will go a long way to shape the players’ careers. “There is a lot which the players have improved on and I believe this is going to add value to their potential,” said Brent. The same was echoed by Ryan Moron, the head of coaching at Cape Town Sports Tours, who was helping with training. “We are happy that there was a good response we got from local schools and academies and we have had many people from the high density areas. “The talent we have seen is encouraging and I believe we will have some future national team players from this crop,” said Maron. One of the parents, Newman Nyamuri, whose son Newman (Jnr) got a chance to play for the visitors Under-14 side, was grateful to Campbell. “I am so happy with my son who is playing in the Dubai Desert Cubs side and I hope it will help him. “This is going to help him gain experience as a national team Under-14 player, we are proud of him as a family. “We are here to support him as sport can be another profession these days. “I think he is going to take all the notes back to his school Prince Edward and to his parent club as well,” said Nyamuri.
