SOUTH African power utility Eskom yesterday confirmed receipt of the US$10 million payment for electricity from Zimbabwe. Government announced last week it had paid US$10 million to Eskom, but the utility indicated last Friday that it had not received the money. Yesterday the company said: “Eskom confirms that the payment made by Zimbabwe is reflecting in its account today (yesterday). “Discussions will continue with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) to find a mutually beneficial solution to the outstanding debt. “Eskom is a commercial operation and will be guided by the contracts we have in place with ZESA.” Energy and Power Development Minister Fortune Chasi yesterday tweeted sarcastically that; “Lies have short legs. This is what I lied about. I am sorry.” Below the tweet was the proof of payment indication that Zesa had paid R139 million, which is equivalent to US$10 million.
