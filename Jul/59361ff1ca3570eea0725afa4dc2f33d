UPCOMING gospel musician Loice Namatai Chinyerere, daughter to prominent United Methodist Church clergyman, Reverend Brain Tanyanyiwa Chinyerere, has released a debut album titled “Jehova Mu”. The seven-track album was recently launched in Harare at a colourful event attended by many religious and business personalities, including Seed Co managing director Denias Zaranyika. Commonly known as Namatai, Chinyerere said: “It is a dream come true. I am so excited that I have launched the album. I have been planning the launch in the last three or four years and I am happy that it has come to pass.” “I am still in shock that the launch went in the way that I wished it should go,” said Chinyerere. During the launch, she belted out tracks from her debut album sending the largely Christian crowd into delirium. One of the tracks enjoyed by many guests  was “Takapiwa Zita”, which implores people to fear nothing as Jesus is their saviour. Asked which of the seven tracks she likes the most, Chinyerere said: “All of them are my favourites because each of them carries a message I wanted to convey. “I love ‘Jehova Mu’, the title track, because the people I will be preaching to are given the opportunity to personalise God. We see God differently, so by only calling the track and album “Jehova Mu”, I wanted my fans to call God whatever they want depending on their experiences with Him. “On the other track, ‘Wakanonoka’, I am telling my listeners that we are winners already because Jesus died for our sins and people should not fear anything including the devil.” Other tracks on the album are “Tirivehumambo”, “Mweya wangu”, Jehovha Mufudzi” and “Tichanoimba”.
