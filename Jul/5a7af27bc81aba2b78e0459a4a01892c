The Herald MANCHESTER. — Marcus Rashford has signed a new four-year contract at Manchester United. The 21-year-old’s new deal also contains the option for United to trigger a further one-year extension. Rashford will earn around £200 000 per week with his new contract, Sky Sports News understands. After Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took charge in December, Rashford has featured regularly under the former United striker’s starting line-ups and was named as the Premier League player of the month for January 2019. Rashford, who made his debut for United in a Europa League game in February 2016, has scored 50 goals and made 26 assists in 184 appearances in all competitions for his hometown club. The England international made his first Premier League start against Arsenal that same season, scoring twice in a 3-2 win at Old Trafford. — Sky Sports.
