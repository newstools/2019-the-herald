The Herald LONDON. — Roger Federer admits he needs as much time as he can get in order to pick himself up for the US Open after Sunday’s Wimbledon tennis final heartbreak. The 37-year-old was defeated in an epic Wimbledon final on Centre Court, finally falling in a fifth-set tie-break after five hours with the scores locked at 2-2 and 12-12. Federer had two championship points in the fifth set to clinch his ninth Wimledon title, but squandered them both. “I don’t know what I feel right now . . . I can’t believe it,” said Federer. “You just always try to push yourself to see things on the better side. But it was definitely tough to have those chances.” While it will take some time to recover from such an anguished defeat, Federer is confident he’ll be adequately prepared for the US Open, having played the clay court season for the first time in three years. He plans to skip the Rodgers Cup which starts August 3, before returning to the tour a week later for the Cincinnati Open. “There’s a lot of positives to take away from the journey I’ve been on for the past few months,” Federer said following the loss to Djokovic. “I mean, looking ahead, we had decided in the team that I was going to skip Montreal anyway already a week ago, and just give myself enough time I wish I had more, but I don’t. — AFP.
