Cabinet yesterday approved the Constitutional Court Bill and the International Treaties Bill, paving way for the legal frameworks to be gazetted before being tabled in Parliament for debate. This was revealed by Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services  Minister Monica Mutsvangwa while addressing journalists on the 25th Cabinet meeting decision matrix yesterday. “Cabinet considered and approved the Constitutional Court Bill which was presented by the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. The Bill will govern the operations of the Constitutional Court. “It is part of the alignment of laws to the Constitution and will also regulate the jurisdiction, powers, practice and procedure of the court,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. “The Bill provides for the composition, regulations, appeals from decisions of lower courts and other matters connected to the operations of the Constitutional Court. Once enacted, the Bill will provide and ensure an effective and efficient justice delivery system.” She said Cabinet had also approved the International Treaties Bill which seeks to provide uniform procedure for the approval of international treaties. “Cabinet considered and approved the International Treaties Bill which was presented by the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. The Bill establishes a uniform procedure for the approval of international treaties by Cabinet and Parliament, and subsequent ratification by the President. “It provides a mechanism for the publication or notification of such treaties. “This will ensure that international treaties, including those having far-reaching consequences on the country’s domestic laws, are concluded only after the due notification of Parliament and the public,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. The approval of the two Bills is expected to culminate in their gazetting before they are tabled before Parliament.
