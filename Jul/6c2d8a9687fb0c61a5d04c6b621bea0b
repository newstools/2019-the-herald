A new golf course, Mulota Hills Golf Club in Ngezi, will host its first high-profile tournament, the Zimplats Invitational, which is expected to attract several top professionals. The event runs from today and tomorrow. The $70,000 purse Zimplats sponsored tournament has attracted a top field of 30 players from the Zimbabwe Professional Golf Association order of merit standings. Zimbabwe’s top five amateur golfers have been invited for the 36-hole tournament to be played in a pro-am format. The inaugural event brings together an unprecedented Zimbabwean field of top players, who includes the country’s top player Scott Vincent. Vincent, will return for the tournament after losing in the play-off in his last event, the Wingate Pro-Am to inform Anyway Katembenuka. Also expected to join the field for the weekend is Stephen Ferreira who shot a course record 62 and finished second on the Sunshine Tour in Kenya. The golf course is the brainchild of Zimplats. ZPGA president, Gary Thompson, said they were happy with the support they got from the sponsors. Set against a mountain ridge and the mine, with the giant silo acting as a target reference point, golfers face the challenge of punishing rough cut against long green fairways.  “The clubhouse creates the first view and first impression of excellence with no let up in a layout that’s simply outstanding.  ‘’It will present a major challenge to all levels of a golfer. “This course will mature and with the right greens that we believe Matkovitch is bringing in, coupled with the local designs already in place, it will be one of the best,” said Thompson. Tournament coordinator Stanley Matutu also said they are happy to be hosting a very good field. “We are very proud of our community and reaching out to showcase it.’’
