The Herald LONDON. – England clinched a remarkable, but hard-fought 143-run win over Ireland in their one-off Test cricket after Chris Woakes and Stuart Broad bowled out the tourists for just 38 on day three yesterday. Set 182 to clinch a historic win in only their third Test match, Ireland crumbled to the lowest-ever Test score at Lord’s in the face of fine opening spells from Woakes (6-17) – who returned Test-best figures – and Broad (4-19). After rain briefly interrupted play early into the Ireland innings, Woakes got the initial breakthrough in the fourth over – with a helping hand from Jonny Bairstow, who took a fine catch low to his left – as Will Porterfield fell for two. Broad added Andy Balbirnie (5) soon after, a routine outside edge to Joe Root at slip, before Woakes – who has a stunning record at Lord’s, with 24 wickets across four Tests, at an astonishing average of 9.75 – ran riot- Sky Sports.
