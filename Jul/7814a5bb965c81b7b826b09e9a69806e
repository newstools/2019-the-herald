The Herald EDINBURGH. — Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool’s Community Shield clash with Manchester City on Sunday will have no bearing on their battle for the English Premier League title. The two sides will renew the rivalry that saw them take the title race to a tense final day last season. City eventually claimed their second successive Premier League crown by a single point as Liverpool’s bid for a first title since 1990 reached a painful conclusion. Klopp’s men made amends for that angst just weeks later as they beat Tottenham in the Champions League final and the Reds are expected to fight it out with City for the major honours again in the coming campaign. A win against Pep Guardiola’s team at Wembley would be a welcome psychological boost for Liverpool. But, having seen his pre-season plans disrupted by the absence of key players such as Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and keeper Alisson due to the Copa America and African Cup of Nations, Klopp isn’t putting too much stock in the result of the curtain-raiser to the English top-fight season. “For me, it has nothing to do with the rest of the season,” Klopp told reporters. “It’s a game and, even if we only have eight players available, I would like to try to win it. “If we win it, good. Will it have an influence on the season? I don’t think so. “If we lose it, not good. Will it have an influence on the season? No, again, I don’t think so. “We have to prove ourselves during the season, not in one game. If I have to say this would be the statement for the season, I would be really mad.” Klopp admitted he was surprised the Community Shield isn’t taken more seriously in England as he prepares to take part in the match for the first time. “It’s a final. This is the first time that I realised nobody sees it like that to be honest. A ‘curtain-raiser’ is unbelievable,” he said. — AFP.
