The Herald LONDON. — Boxing legend Pernell Whitaker has died at the age of 55 after being hit by a car in Virginia, United States. Whitaker won world titles at four different weights and is considered among the best to have ever laced up a pair of gloves. According to TMZ, he was hit by the vehicle on Sunday night and later died of his injuries. Daughter Dominique said in a statement: “To everyone please respect my family’s privacy in this trying moment. “I want to inform people that today we lost a legend truly one of boxing’s greatest pound-for-pound champions, my father Pernell “Sweet Pea’ Whitaker.” Whitaker, nicknamed “Sweet Pea”, won Olympic gold in 1984 before turning professional in the same year and will be remembered as perhaps the best defensive fighter of all time. Floyd Mayweather paid an emotional tribute to Whitaker, sharing a photo of the pair on Saturday. “R I P champ, one of the best fighters to ever do it,” he wrote. He lost his first challenge for a world title against Jose Luis Ramirez four years later but won another version against Greg Hauden in 1989. Whitaker then went on an unbeaten run until 1997 when he ran into Oscar De La Hoya before losing two of this final three fights. He retired in 2001 following a loss to Carlos Bojorquez as Whitaker finished his career with a record of 40-4-1. — The Mirror.
