Jeremiah Haisoswi (30) of Epworth appeared before Magistrate Miss Rufaro Panavanhu charged with causing the deaths of 19 passengers who were in the commuter omnibus that was travelling from Murambinda to Harare. The haulage truck that Haisoswi was driving encroached onto the lane of the commuter omnibus, resulting in the crash. Sixteen people died on the spot while three others died on admission at Chivhu Hospital. Haisoswi was remanded out of custody on free bail to July 16 for trial.
