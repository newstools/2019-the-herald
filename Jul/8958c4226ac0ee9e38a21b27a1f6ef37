The Herald LONDON. — David de Gea will sign a new long-term contract at Manchester United that will make him the best-paid goalkeeper in the world. The Spain international has been offered between £350 000 and £375 000 per week to remain at Old Trafford. And de Gea (28) will become the world’s highest paid goalkeeper after agreeing a new six-year contract with Manchester United worth around £117 million. But Romelu Lukaku remains determined to quit United and is hoping Inter Milan come back with an improved offer after the Italian club had an opening £54 million bid rejected. De Gea — who made his first appearance of pre-season in United’s 1-0 win over Inter Milan in Singapore on Saturday — will put pen to paper on the new deal, which is believed to be worth around £375 000 a week, once he returns to Manchester from the tour. Yet while the United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will be relieved about the clarity over De Gea’s future, Lukaku remains stuck in limbo. Teenage striker Mason Greenwood again took full advantage of Lukaku’s continued absence with the only goal against Inter in the International Champions Cup at Singapore’s National Stadium, three days after claiming his first senior goal in the 4-0 victory against Leeds United in Perth. Solskjaer has ruled out any prospect of Greenwood being loaned out as the 17-year-old further boosted his chances of starting United’s opening Premier League game against Chelsea on August 11. Solskjaer suggested for the first time on Saturday that United are able to play “a different way” without Lukaku but the manager risks being stuck with the Belgium striker unless Inter find a way of getting closer to his £90 million valuation.  — The Telegraph.
