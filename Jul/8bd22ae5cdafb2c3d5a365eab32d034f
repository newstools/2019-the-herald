Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade yesterday expressed its willingness and readiness to work with the new British Foreign Minister and First Secretary of State, Mr Dominic Raab following his appointment by incoming Prime Minister Mr Boris Johnson. In his congratulatory message yesterday, Minister Sibusiso Moyo described Mr Raab’s appointment as a clear reflection of the confidence and trust the British prime minister had in his capabilities. “I have the honour to extend to you my heartfelt congratulations on your appointment as the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and First Secretary of State of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. “Your assignment to this esteemed office is clear reflection of the confidence and trust that Prime Minister Johnson has in your capabilities,” said Minister Moyo. Minister Moyo said his ministry was looking forward to an accelerated re-engagement process, which will ultimately lead to normalisation of relations between Great Britain and Zimbabwe. “As you assume your new responsibilities, I assure you of my willingness and readiness to work closely with you in furthering and indeed accelerating the process of re-engagement between our two governments, leading to the full normalisation of relations between our nations and peoples,” said Minister Moyo. He reiterated and emphasised President Mnangagwa’s sentiments on the need to concentrate on potential of the future relationship rather than lingering on a complicated past. “I look forward to meeting you and to working closely with you and your team as we build that new relationship and as we seek to realise the enormous potential which so clearly exists in terms of much enhanced trade, investment and tourism ties and of course close cooperation in a wide variety of other spheres of mutual interest and concern,” said Minister Moyo.
