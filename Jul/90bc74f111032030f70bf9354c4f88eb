WITH Zimbabwe making their first appearance at the Vitality Netball World Cup, for many of their players this is an opportunity to learn and get exposure of playing at this level. Among those players is 19-year-old Claris Kwaramba, who is the youngest member of the team. For her, the experience has been amazing as her journey continues with the national team after graduating from the Under-21 side that took part at the World Youth Cup in 2017. “I am very happy that we have been beating some of these teams, especially Northern Ireland, they are ranked number eight, above us, but we managed to beat them. “We are playing with some of the best teams in the world, which is good for exposure. “Being here means I am making progress and I am working hard because there are so many good players in Zimbabwe but I made the senior team to represent the country at the World Cup. I will continue working hard to be successful,” said Kwaramba. Kwaramba, who plays wing defence and goal defence, said one of the important lessons she has learnt is to work hard and is hoping they continue to make an impression at the world tournament that ends on Sunday.
