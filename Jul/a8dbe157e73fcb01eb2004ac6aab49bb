PROFESSIONAL golfers, who were supposed to be practicing for the annual Zimbabwe Open, have received sad news that the country’s premier golf tournament has been cancelled. It was scheduled for August 28 to September 2 at Royal Harare. But the organisers say they can’t pay international players in local currency. The local professionals took to the field at the weekend at the inaugural Wingate Park Pro-Challenge tournament, after a long lay-off. Zimbabwe Professional Golf Association president, Garry Thompson, confirmed yesterday the tournament has been cancelled. “We are sad to announce that the Zimbabwe Open has been cancelled forthwith, we were hopeful that we would see our players taking part in the tournament. “As ZPGA we, however, find solace in that local tournaments are coming and recently we held the inaugural Wingate Park Pro Challenge and up next is the Platinum Challenge in Kadoma,” said Thompson. At the Wingate Pro Challenge, in-form Anywhere Katembenuka beat Asian Tour player Scott Vincent in a playoff after they had finished tied.
