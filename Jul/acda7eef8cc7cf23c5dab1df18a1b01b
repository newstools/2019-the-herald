They accused Mr Dube of abuse of office, among other allegations. Bulawayo mayor Councillor Solomon Mguni lifted the suspension the following day. The Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing has appointed a team to investigate circumstances leading to Mr Dube’s suspension. The council’s Chamber Secretary Mrs Sikhangele Zhou, through a letter yesterday, notified the councillors of the pending investigations. “Please be informed that an investigations team has been dispatched to investigate the recent events surrounding the suspension of the Town Clerk. The investigating team from the Ministry will arrive in Bulawayo tomorrow (18th July 2019) and will start work on the 19th July, 2019.”
