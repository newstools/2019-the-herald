The Herald LONDON. – Arsenal are open to letting Laurent Koscielny leave the club provided their valuation is met, Sky Sports News understands. The Gunners have opened internal disciplinary proceedings against Koscielny after he refused to travel on a pre-season tour to the United States. Koscielny has one year remaining on his contract and wants to be released for free and be able to return to France. Speaking after Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Colorado Rapids on Monday, Unai Emery said: “For me as a coach Koscielny’s an important player. Now it’s a matter for him and the club”. Emery has also assured fans that he is working “patiently” with new technical director Edu on bolstering Arsenal’s squad before the transfer window closes. Arsenal have only brought in 18-year-old forward Gabriel Martinelli with less than a month until deadline day, but the likes of Kieran Tierney, Wilfried Zaha and Nicolas Pepe continue to be heavily linked. Though the Gunners have had bids rejected for both Tierney and Zaha in recent weeks, Emery remains hopeful that he will get the reinforcements he needs in time for the 2019/20 campaign.  – Sky Sports.
