The Herald R  Kelly was arrested on child pornography and federal sex trafficking charges after former enablers and ex-employees allegedly turned on him. The singer was arrested by New York police detectives from the department of Homeland Security last Thursday after it is thought some 20 videos of Kelly having sex with under-age girls were handed to law enforcement. Gerald Griggs, who represents Joycelyn Savage’s family among others, alleged the tapes “were exactly what the feds needed to secure indictments for sex crimes, including child pornography”. Joseph D. Fitzpatrick, spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office of the Northern District of Illinois, confirmed Kelly had been arrested on a 13-count indictment:  “The indictment includes charges of child pornography, enticement of a minor, and obstruction of justice.” Joceyln Savage is one of many women associated with R Kelly and his sexual abuse allegations; the 23-year-old currently lives with the singer and her parents claim she has been ‘brainwashed’. Kelly previously appeared in court in Chicago in June, where he pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of sexual assault which were brought against him on May 30 following documentary “Surviving R Kelly”. The documentary series featured various women who accused Kelly of abuse, with these charges stemming from claims by Jerhonda Pace. The singer was charged with five counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and two counts of criminal sexual assault. Kelly was previously charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in February, where the singer pleaded not guilty and was released on bail after paying the US$1 million bail. He has adamantly denied all the allegations. In an interview on CBS he said he was “very tired of all the lies”. — Metro.
