The Herald SAO PAULO. — Argentina forwards Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero will have to sweat if they’re going to break down Brazil’s watertight defence in their Copa America semi-final football match today, says Selecao striker Gabriel Jesus. Hosts Brazil have yet to concede a goal in four matches at the Copa while Argentina have improved defensively and kept clean sheets in their last two matches. Jesus expects a tight contest in Belo Horizonte today and says Brazil’s defence won’t give Argentina’s forward line an inch. “It’s tough to get behind a defence that doesn’t concede goals,” the Manchester City forward said of Argentina’s back-line. “It’s also a long time since we conceded a goal. It’s very important to have a solid defence. “But it won’t be easy for Argentina to get behind us. Obviously they have Messi who is the best player in the world, and they have Aguero, one of the best center-forwards, but they’re going to have to sweat to get in behind.” — AFP.
