The Herald Blessings Chidakwa in Victoria Falls
President Mnangagwa is today expected to address the Rural District Councils chairpersons indaba which started here yesterday. This will be the first time the RDC’s chairpersons will be meeting the Head of State and Government. Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister July Moyo confirmed the attendance of President Mnangagwa yesterday, but declined to give more details saying he would pre-empt the President’s address. Association of Rural District Council of Zimbabwe (ARDCZ) chief executive Dr Isaac Matsilele said they were honoured that the President will be part of their indaba and they were looking forward to their engagement. “This edition of our indaba is very special because we will be hosting His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe,” he said. Dr Matsilele said the President’s invitation to grace the indaba came as a result of calls from council chairpersons and chief executives before, during and after provincial chapter outreach meetings. The ARDCZ indaba ends tomorrow.
