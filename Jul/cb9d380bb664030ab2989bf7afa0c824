THE Commander Zimbabwe Defence Forces, General Philip Valerio Sibanda, has challenged the ZDF teams competing in Fifth International Army Games in Russia to bring home medals. The Games are scheduled to start on August 3. Bidding farewell to the teams in Domboshava, Sibanda reminded them they were representing the nation. “As you go there you are representing the country, you are our sporting ambassadors, and symbols of our national identity which help foster a sense of national pride, among us, the citizens,” he said. “As you venture into the competitions, represent our country before the eyes of the world, all from behind here will rally behind you and we want to see you bring medals home.” Sibanda said the International Army Games were introduced in 2015 as a way of cementing relations between like-minded nations. “The Russia Games continue to draw more nations into participation as this year,  32 nations are expected to participate,’’ he said. ‘’This tremendous growth over a period of four years is a clear manifestation of the importance attached to these Games as a global showpiece.” He said the number of African nations participating in the Games has increased to nine this year, from three at the start, with Angola, Algeria,  Mozambique, Egypt, Morocco, Madascar, Tunisia, Uganda and Zimbabwe having confirmed their participation.  The ZDF will battle it out in six out of 28 disciplines. They will battle in Tank Biathlon, Suvorov Attack, Sniper Frontier, Master of Artillery, Military Medical Relay and Horse Guards Marathon. The International Army Games will be held in 10 countries – Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia and Uzbekistan. More than 6 000 participants are expected to grace the month-long events.
