The Herald LONDON. — Gareth Bale has agreed to join Jiangsu Suning for a staggering £1 million per week, according to sensational reports in China. The Chinese Super League football club are thought to be ready to splash the cash to lure the Welshman (30) to the Far East — with Bale allegedly ready to move. Journalist Bai Guohua made the staggering revelation on social media platform Weibo this morning. He wrote: “Congratulations to fans of Suning Club!” Guohua then added that Jiangsu had beaten off competition from rivals Beijing Guo’an to sign the Real Madrid star. Bale is expected to leave the Bernabeu after boss Zinedine Zidane said it would be “best for everyone” if he moved on after six years with the club. But his high wages, currently around £600 000, have priced out plenty of potentially-interested club. A move to China or Bayern Munich is most likely with a Premier League return seemingly off the cards financially. Local media outlet Sina Sport say that both Jiangsu Suning and Beijing Guo’an offered lucrative contracts to Bale. Suning are based in the city of Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province in East China. They finished fifth in the Chinese Super League last season and currently sit in sixth position with 11 games remaining this term. Their Instagram page — which has not been verified and has just 13.1k followers compared to Bale’s 40.5m – follows just 34 users, but one of those is that of @garethbale11, the winger’s verified account. — The Sun.
