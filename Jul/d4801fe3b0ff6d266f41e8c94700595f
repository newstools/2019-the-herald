The Herald LONDON. – David De Gea is set to sign a new deal with Manchester United worth £97.5million – making him the world’s highest-paid goalkeeper. De Gea’s future has been uncertain, with the Spain and United No.1 in the final year of his contract and able to leave as a free agent next summer. Talks have been going on between United and De Gea’s representatives, who wanted parity with Alexis Sanchez, the club’s highest-paid player in £500 000-a-week. United were not prepared to stretch that far for De Gea, but a compromise is understood to have been reached, with the 28-year-old set to pocket £375 000-a-week under the terms of the new deal. De Gea is likely to put pen to paper on the lucrative new deal when United return from their pre-season tour of Australia and the Far East, with the new agreement likely to be for five years. The 28-year-old joined United from Atletico Madrid in 2011 for £18.9m and has since emerged as arguably the best goalkeeper in the world, proving his enduring worth despite the team’s recent struggles. Paris St Germain had hoped to lure De Gea away from United this summer or next, but an outline agreement over a contract extension is understood to have been reached. – The Mirror.
