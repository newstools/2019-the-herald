ALL is set for the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee vice presidency election tomorrow with three candidates vying for the coveted post. Seasoned administrators Kathy Lobb, Sekesai Nhokwara and Fungai Zinatsa are the three candidates who will battle for the post at Prince Edward. The post fell vacant when swimming legend Kirsty Coventry was appointed Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister. The election proceedings are the last item on the ZOC general assembly. ZOC chief executive Anna Mguni yesterday said they had followed through the election roadmap. Mguni also said they will present their audited accounts. “We will obviously confirm those associations which are in good standing. There would be the report on activities of the board with effect from July last year, our last General Assembly, up to now and, of course, the audited accounts. “We have had our audit done by PricewaterhouseCoopers and these would be presented to the General Assembly, including the budgets and any motions that come from the General Assembly,’’ said Mguni.
