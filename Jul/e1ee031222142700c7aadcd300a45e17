DYNAMOS newboy Evans Katema says he wouldn’t have joined the Glamour Boys at a better time than just a few days before the Harare Derby against CAPS United at Rufaro on Sunday. The dreadlocked striker switched from league débutantes Mushowani Stars last week where he was the top-scorer with seven goals. The 30-year-old almost single-handedly destroyed the Green Machine with his brace for Mushowani before a 2-3 loss in May. And he could be a huge factor on Sunday as he faces the same side whose central defence partnership of Method Mwanjali, and Godwin Goriyati, he bullied while in the Mushowani stripes the last time out. For him, playing in the Harare Derby has always been a dream and he wants to do it in style. “I am happy for having joined Dynamos and I did well in my first appearance although I feel we should have won against Black Rhinos. “We face CAPS United in our next encounter and it promises to be a thriller. “It was my dream to one day feature in the famous derby. As a kid, and as a football player, I always wished to play in a high-stakes contest like the one we are preparing for. “Obviously, it will not be an easy one, CAPS United are a top team and they deserve all the respect in this world. “But, then, we are also a team with belief, a team with own targets. We are not far off the leading pack and beating one of the favourites will do a lot in terms of lifting our confidence levels,” said Katema. Dynamos are running around to secure papers for prodigal son Archford Gutu whom they also signed a few days ago. Former players Simba Nhivi and Godknows Murwira have also rejoined the Glamour Boys. Nhivi marked his return last weekend while Murwira could feature against Makepekepe.
