All is set for the Enlighten the World gospel music concert slated for Harare Gardens on Saturday where yesteryear and upcoming gospel musicians are expected to share the stage. Event organiser Tonderai Mayinori said the event was meant to create a platform where gospel musicians unite and share notes. “This is a family show, which starts at around 1pm running until late,” he said. Mayinori said there will be surprise acts that have been lined up for the show, which is demanding ZWL$10 at the gate. “The performers are a mix of the new and old generation and we hope to give gospel music fans a day to savour. “We are also working on some surprise acts to spice things up and we are geared for a memorable event,” he said. Mayinori said his events management company, Enlighten the World, were planning to host other shows with proceeds channelled to charity. “We have hosted quite a number of concerts and worship nights in our local churches with proceeds going to charity. “With the same dedication and determination that made our own events successful, we have come together to present the annual gospel Enlighten the World Concert. We will invite all gospel followers to come and join us,” Mayinori said. Renowned gospel musician, Baba Mechanic Manyeruke, urged people from all walks of life to attend the gospel show. “There is something unique about gospel music and I encourage all gospel music lovers to come and celebrate the goodness of the Lord with us. There are so many things to thank God for, life included, and we are geared to give fans the best,” he said. Manyeruke will share the stage with Zim Praise’s Mpostori Wency, Nyasha Mutonhori, Spirit Praise Choir and Joyful Praise Choir of “Ngoro Yeminana” fame.
