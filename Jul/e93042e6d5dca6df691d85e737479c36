The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal are open to selling Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but will demand at least £56 million for the striker, according to reports. The 30-year-old ended up sharing the Golden Boot in his first full season in the English Premier League by scoring 22 goals for Arsenal, while he netted another eight times in the Europa League. But Arsenal’s campaign ended badly as Unai Emery’s side were beaten by Chelsea in the Europa League final, meaning that they failed to qualify for next season’s Champions League football.  That setback has severely restricted Arsenal’s transfer budget this summer as the club have £45m to spend and need to offload several first-team players if they want to boost their funds. According to The Times, the Gunners have made Mesut Ozil and Henrikh Mkhitaryan available but both players have not attracted any interest. The club would also consider offloading Aubameyang but their initial asking price would be £56 million — which is what they paid to sign the striker from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018. Earlier this month, Aubameyang was linked with a shock move to Manchester United, while reports in Italy claimed last week that he had “agreed” a switch to Old Trafford. Arsenal, meanwhile, are looking to raise their funds as they are keen to complete a deal with Crystal Palace for Wilfried Zaha. The Cote d’lvoire international is valued at £80m by Palace, while the club are also reluctant to sell their star player after agreeing a £50m deal with Manchester United for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Zaha, however, is understood to be intent on a move to Arsenal and is hoping that Palace lower their asking price. Crystal Palace are determined not to lose Zaha this summer and have slapped a £100 million price tag on his head as he continues to be linked with Arsenal. — Metro.
