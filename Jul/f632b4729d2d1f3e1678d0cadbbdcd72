SWISS handball coach Rolf Haussener is confident that the assembled national team squad is capable to compete and produce results at an international level. Haussener was in the country for a seven-day training camp with the Under-19 team, which ended on Tuesday last week at the Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex.  This is part of the Zimbabwe Handball Federation’s long-term plan to have a team that can qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. This was his third visit to the country to continue with the efforts to try and form a strong foundation for future senior national teams. The ZHF are hoping that by 2023 they will have a formidable team that can challenge for a place at the African Games as well as qualify for the 2024 Olympics Games. Speaking to The Herald, Haussener said though there is still some work to be done tactically, he was impressed by the team’s development and performance. “I’m impressed by the squad commitment and ability to learn so quickly to the tactics and style of play we want. “I know this country have a lot of raw talent, which l believe if natured can produce world-class players. “We know if we continue working hard we will be able to qualify for the 2024 Olympics Games and I’m very optimistic we will achieve that,’’ said Haussener.
