BINDURA University of Science Education sprinter, Leon Tafirenyika, is shining at the Universities World Cup currently underway in Napoli, Italy, where he has secured a spot in the 200m semi-finals. Tafirenyika, ran a time of 21.42s to earn a spot in this evening’s semi-final. He came third in his heat. And this was a day after he had attained seventh place in the 400m with a time of 47.07s. Tafirenyika is the only Zimbabwean athlete still standing at The Games, which are known as Summer Universiade. The other athlete, Thembela Ndlovu, a female tennis player, lost all her matches. Only two athletes managed to travel for this year’s World Cup. The other 10 athletes failed to make the trip after their tertiary institutions failed to secure foreign currency for airfares and accommodation in Europe. Tafirenyika and Ndlovu, and one official, made the trip after receiving sponsorship from the International University Sports Federation which funds two exceptional athletes.
