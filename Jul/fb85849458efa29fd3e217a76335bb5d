THE Mighty Warriors and their Under-20 counterparts are expected to go into camp today to begin preparations for the COSAFA Women Championships. The tournament will be staged in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, from next Wednesday. Zimbabwe will take on Angola in the opening match at the Nelson Mandela Bay. The following day, August 1, the Young Mighty Warriors will meet South Africa in the opening match of the inaugural developmental tournament. Mighty Warriors coach, Sithetheliwe “Kwinji 15” Sibanda, had indicated that good preparations were key and had wanted a longer training period. As for the Under-20 team, new coach Rosemary Mugadza will also have to work round the clock to assemble a competitive side. Yesterday, ZIFA spokesperson Xolisani Gwesela said they will only announce the COSAFA squads after they have finished sending invitational letters to the players. The senior team are in a group that also features Angola, Mozambique and Eswatini. Meanwhile, Mozambique coach Sara Simone has named her provisional squad which she believes will make it to the semi-finals. Simone has chosen a side that has both youth and experience, including forward Cidalia Cuta, who netted twice in last year’s competition. The youngest member of the squad is 19-year-old defender Virginia Fernando, while the oldest is veteran defender Amelia Elias, who will be 33.
