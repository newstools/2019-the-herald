The Herald CHINHOYI University of Technology (CUT) hosts its second annual fundraising golf tournament today at the Chinhoyi Golf Club. Since inception, the University has been seized with the need to transform inherited teachers’ college buildings into modern university infrastructure. As a stakeholder-driven higher and tertiary education institution, the University’s vision is to produce holistic graduates who are both spiritually and physically empowered hence its need to build a Chapel and a Sports Pavilion. The Chinhoyi Fundraising Golf tournament is open to individual golfers and teams from across the country. Tee-off time is eight in the morning and the tournament will conclude with a cocktail in the evening where a live musical band will also entertain golfers. — CUT.
