The Herald Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange
Hwange ………………………… (1) 1 Bulawayo Chiefs ………………..0 HWANGE  finally remembered how to win a game after they put up a polished performance to dismantle Bulawayo Chiefs in this Castle Lager Premiership football match at the Colliery yesterday. The victory, which came against a patch of a seven-match winless streak for the coalminers, belonged to gangling new signing Kasimero Chimbadzwa, who grabbed the all-important goal in the 25th minute in his first game as a Chipangano player. The former Black Mambas striker’s goal came at the end of some lovely inter-play between Gilbert Zulu and Vasilli Kawe to hammer home a blistering low effort past an exposed Chiefs goalkeeper David Bizabani. Before the goal and for the better part of the match, Hwange had laid siege in the Bulawayo Chiefs’ half but failed to turn their advantage into an avalanche of goals which could have left Chiefs an embarrassed lot. Veteran Hwange striker Gilbert Zulu and substitute Dingani Maphosa hit the post on either side of the break. When Bulawayo Chiefs started to show some pulse in the contest in the last half, they found youthful goalkeeper Collen Phiri and another young defender Lucas Sibanda in no more mood for favours in the heart of Hwange defence. The visitors’ big chance to get something from nowhere in the game came two minutes from time but midfielder Tafadzwa Dhliwayo blasted into the skies his effort with the goalkeeper to beat. Hwange goalkeepers’ coach Edmore Sibanda was happy to collect maximum points and was upbeat the miners can also feast on Chicken Inn in their next game to continue with their revival. Chiefs head coach Farai Tawachera tore into his goalkeeper for letting in cheap goals in recent matches but said his charges played a decent game despite the loss.
