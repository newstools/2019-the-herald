THE Sports and Recreation Commission have reported the suspended members of the Zimbabwe Cricket board to the police for obstructing the course of justice in the investigations of an alleged fraud involving US$2,8 million. The entire ZC board led by Tavengwa Mukuhlani was put on suspension last week by SRC on allegations of financial misappropriation among a litany of misdeeds. The association’s acting managing director, Givemore Makoni, was also suspended.
The SRC have since placed an interim committee headed by veteran sports administrator David Ellman-Brown to run the affairs of the association while a forensic audit is instituted. However, their efforts have been met with a strong resistance from the suspended members and employees, who have reportedly locked up the premises and ordered critical staff to stay away from work. SRC acting director-general Shepherd Mukanhairi said they wrote to Police Commissioner Godwin Matanga’s office this week after their efforts to launch an inquiry into the operations of the association were frustrated. “As you will be aware, the SRC suspended the entire Zimbabwe Cricket Board of Directors on 19 June, 2019. This included the acting managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket, Givemore Makoni. “The SRC require an urgent investigation into the use of US$2,8 million debited to the account of Zimbabwe Cricket with MetBank Zimbabwe Limited. Zimbabwe Cricket does not accept liability for the US$2,8million whereas MetBank states that the liability belongs to Zimbabwe Cricket,’” wrote Mukanhairi in his correspondence to the ZRP
