(1) 2 HWANGE’s woes in the Castle Lager Premiership football continued to mount as the coalminers yesterday slumped to a fifth consecutive defeat after falling to visiting Triangle at their Colliery home ground. Goals from Trevor Mavhunga and Timothy January either side of the half won the match for the visitors. Ernest Gwitima had reduced the arrears for the home side from the spot just before the breather but the goal did not save them. The sad faces at the end of the match yesterday told big tales of despair, agony and fear of a repeat of the 2017 season when the team was relegated, only to bounce back after spending a season in the second tier league. On the other hand, Triangle will care less about Hwange’s alarming negative slide as they have seemingly turned the corner after a difficult spell which preceded a run of two wins on the trot. Triangle settled down late in the match as the hosts dictated the pace in the opening 20 minutes in a period their goalkeeper Ronald Mudimu made some spectacular saves to deny Gilbert Zulu and Arlton Ndlovu. The Sugar Sugar Boys only proved sweet in the last five minutes of the opening half with their first corner in the 41st minute proving decisive after Mavhunga rose high to connect a teasing Gerald Bero corner into the back of the nets. Their lead was, however, short-lived as Hwange drew level from the spot on the stroke of half-time after referee Thembinkosi Sibanda adjudged that defender Arnold Chivheya had handled a goal-bound screamer from Ernest Gwitima.
