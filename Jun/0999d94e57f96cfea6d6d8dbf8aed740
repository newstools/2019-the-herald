The Herald DRAG racing enthusiasts were on Sunday treated to a rare feat as they watched a couple winning the elimination contest in beasts of motor vehicles; the latest Mercedes Benz nicknamed TP1 and TP2 as they clocked the fastest times over the quarter-mile distance at Donnybrook Park Raceway in Harare. The youthful couple – Samuel and Grace Dimaro – clocked 12.2 seconds over the 400-metre stretch to clinch the elimination series and kissed each other after the race as they saluted the fans. The youthful IT specialist Samuel and his wife Grace left the fans yearning for more as they displayed class and oozed with confidence, sweeping aside all before them in just their second try at the elimination contest. The race has in the past been dominated by Terry Alberry, in his black AC Cobra, and Mano Zevgolis, in his modified Toyota XR7. The Dimaro couple beat stiff competition from Lambert and Moyo, both driving BMW3 series popularly known on the streets as “Gusheshes”. The AC Cobra was, however, missing at this race meeting but Zevgolis blew the engine of his turbo-boosted Toyota XR7 which is sponsored by Castrol/hp lubes after clocking a personal best time of 10 seconds over the quarter-mile stretch.  –  ZBC Online
