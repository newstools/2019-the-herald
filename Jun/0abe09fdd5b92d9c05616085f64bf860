Chapungu finished the game with ten men after Collen Kwaramba was shown a second yellow card towards the end of the duel. Coach Rodwell Dhlakama felt his men could have taken three points from the context. “It was a good game, played in good spirits, and I think supporters enjoyed this game. “We created a number of chances and with a bit of accuracy i think we could have won this game. “But such is football, you get some wins and some games you will not win, overally we are on the right track,” said Dhlakama. TelOne coach, Jairos Tapera, said it was a fair result. “We played very well and we missed some good chances towards the end which could have given us maximum points. “But this was a fair result as both sides played very good football and a draw is a good result. “I am very happy with the way these boys have been playing, remember the bulk of them are in their first year in the Premier League,” said Tapera.
