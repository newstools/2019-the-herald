The Herald Johannesburg. — Kayise Ngqula’s husband Farai Sibanda died over the weekend after sustaining injuries in a car accident.
The former Our Perfect Wedding presenter was travelling with her husband when the accident happened in the early hours of the morning last Sunday in Sandton. Sibanda was in ICU for almost a week before he succumbed to his injuries.
Ngqula’s mother Fikiswa Gatya confirmed the news to Sowetan LIVE and said her daughter was currently in hospital recovering from the injuries.
The deceased was driving the car. “She is stable. She is recovering from some fractures on her body. One can say she’s out of danger now,” Gatya said. The couple got married last August before welcoming a baby boy. “She is devastated as you can imagine. They have an eight-month-old baby. Even their union is fairly new. She’s really struggling,” Gatya said. Gatya said Sibanda’s funeral arrangements were not yet finalised.
“The family is still in discussion. He is of Zimbabwean origin, so the family has been informed and some of them are already here. They arrived as soon as they were informed of the accident,” she explained. Speaking to DRUM, head of publicity, local entertainment channels at Mzansi Magic, Philly Khubeka confirmed that Farai’s death was caused by the accident and requested privacy for the families during their time of grieving. “It is with great sadness that we confirm that Kayise Ngqula has lost her husband in a car accident. As our former OPW presenter — Mzansi Magic would appreciate that the media give both families the respect and privacy during this grieving process. Kayise will not be doing any interviews regarding this matter,” he said.
