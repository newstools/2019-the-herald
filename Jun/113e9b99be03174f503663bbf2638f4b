The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal have reportedly agreed a contract with long-time target Yannick Carrasco to take him to the Emirates. Dalian Yifang are demanding Arsenal pay a fee in excess of £25 million to complete the signing of Carrasco who is a teammate of Zimbabwe international forward, Nyasha Mushekwi. The Gunners are keen on bringing in at least one winger this summer and have revived their interest in the 25-year-old after failing to complete a loan deal in January. However, he is still far from certain to become the club’s first signing of the summer. Carrasco (25) was first linked with a loan move to Unai Emery’s team in January, but his employers were unwilling to sanction a temporary deal. Arsenal took Denis Suarez instead, much to the annoyance of Sven Mislintat who preferred the Belgian, but Suarez is now back at Barcelona after a disappointing stint in north London. SportMediaSet claim that Carrasco has agreed terms with the Gunners over a move to the Emirates. The claims come after, in an interview with Belgium’s Nieuwsblad over the weekend, Carrasco stated that he was closing on a return to Europe and stated why he is so keen to return from the Far East: “Negotiations are going well. “I am aware that I am an important player for the team but I hope the chairman understands and they let me leave. “From a personal and family point of view, I would like to return to Europe and stay closer to my family. — The Mirror.
