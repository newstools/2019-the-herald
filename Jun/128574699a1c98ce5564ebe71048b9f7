THE Physical Disability T20 cricket team, which is expected to represent the country at the 2019 edition of the tournament, is racing against time to put their house in order ahead of their dream trip to England before August 2. The team, which has 14 players and seven officials, is yet to secure passports for most of its athletes and speaking at a Press conference on Tuesday, the board chairman Lewis Garaba said they were happy with preparations, although they are lagging behind. “It is my pleasure to announce that we are looking forward to take part in this year’s edition of the Physical Disability T20 cricket tournament to be held by England and Wales from August 2 to 17. “The team is made up of 14 players and seven officials. Zimbabwe will be expected to play against five other countries which include England, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India.” The Zimbabwe team still has a lot to cover as some of the players are still awaiting their passports and the team’s general manager Tendai “T-Buns” Zhakata said they are looking forward to raise some funds in time for the tournament. “I am happy to be tasked to be one of the fundraising members again after we successfully took the Homeless World Cup team last year. This year we are going with the disabled cricket team and I am appealing to the corporate world to come on board. “We are very lucky this year that our teams are managing to qualify for the world stages with the man national soccer team at AFCON finals and the netball team set for the World Cup as well, so we are happy. “We are looking forward to fund-raise about US$66 000 for the team to successfully go there and experience a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” said Zhakata.
