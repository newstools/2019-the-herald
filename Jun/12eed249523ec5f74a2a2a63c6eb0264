THE Zimbabwe Under-20 national women’s rugby team got a timely boost ahead of their historic bilateral series against South Africa Under-20 side at Prince Edward this afternoon and Saturday. Zimbabwe will host their first international match and several corporates have responded positively with three local commercial partners coming on board. The three, which includes leading TV Production House, Sand Sport Zimbabwe, Enhanced Uniforms Solutions and National Blood Services Zimbabwe, all wish to see the series succeed. Sand Sport will be the television partners for the series as EUS are the new kit sponsors while NBSZ are supporting the young women’s corporate social responsibility drive. Zimbabwe’s Under-20 side will be clad in locally manufactured apparel from their new kit sponsor Enhanced Uniforms Solutions (EUS). EUS has come on board as the team’s kit sponsor after news of the women’s success at junior levels in the South Africa Youth Weeks this year at Under-18 level where the girls had two wins and a draw and are now ranked second behind Western Province in the competition.
