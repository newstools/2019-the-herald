The Herald LONDON. — Italian Serie A football champions Juventus have reportedly made an initial enquiry to Manchester United over the chances of bringing Paul Pogba back to the club this summer. Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici has contacted Old Trafford chiefs to discover the World Cup winner’s availability. According to Italian broadcaster Sky Sport, Manchester United are willing to sell Pogba for the right price. It is claimed the English Premier League giants are looking for more than €100m (£87.4m) to consider sanctioning a deal. Juventus are reportedly considering all potential ways to tempt the Red Devils into selling. Pogba’s future remains uncertain at present but the Frenchman looks increasingly likely to leave Old Trafford in the coming months. Real Madrid have been heavily linked with a move for the midfielder while Juve are said to retain major interest in agreeing a deal. Now, according to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, the reigning Italian Serie A champions have contacted United to test the waters before making an official bid. It is claimed Juventus have started talks with Pogba’s agent Mino Raiola and are expecting a decision from United over his future sooner rather than later. Pogba moved to Turin after his initial exit from Old Trafford in 2012 and went on to win four Serie A titles and the Coppa Italia twice. Despite split opinion on Pogba’s worth to the United team, he contributed 13 goals and nine assists last term and has a deal until the summer of 2021 following his 2016 transfer of a then world record fee of £89million. Zinedine Zidane is also said to be desperate to take Pogba to the Bernabeu as the French legend plots a major squad overhaul following a disappointing season. — Mailonline.
