The Herald Gold rallied yesterday with the prospect of an interest-rate reduction by the Federal Reserve, amid signs of economic weakness in the US, lifting the metal’s price to its highest in 3 ½ months. Futures prices touched highs near $1,349 an ounce after a report early yesterday on private-sector employment for May from payroll processor ADP said employers hired 27 000 people in the month — marking the lowest growth since March of 2010. “The ADP data was a huge disappointment for the dollar bulls. Usually this number sets the tone for the biggest economic number, the US (non-farm payrolls due for release Friday morning] and it appears that this week (that report) is also going to print a soft number,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets UK. “This is the primary reason that we have seen a massive surge in the gold price,” he said. “If the economic numbers start to derail in this way, then the only way for the gold price is up.” Gold for August delivery on Comex GCM19, +0.54 percent rose $10,50, or 0,8 percent, to $1 339,20 an ounce. Most-active contract prices haven’t settled at a level this high since February 20, according to FactSet data. Yesterday so far, they peaked at $1 348,90, which would also be the highest intra-day level since February, but prices haven’t settled at a level that high since April 18, 2018. The precious metal is on pace for a sixth consecutive gain, which would be the longest win streak since an 11-day rally ended Jan. 5, 2018. Gold has seen a nearly 5 percent year-to-date advance, and a more than 2 percent rise so far this month. Meanwhile, July silver SIN19, +0,48 percent added 15,6 cents, or 1,1 percent, to $14,925 an ounce. —Reuters.
