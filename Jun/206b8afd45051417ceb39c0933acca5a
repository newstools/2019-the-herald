The Herald Cloud Fusire Sports Reporter PROMISING junior swimmer Donata Katai’s quest to represent the country at her first FINA World Junior Swimming Championships hangs in the balance because of lack of sponsorship. The five-day event is slated for August 20 to 25 in Budapest, Hungary. Donata’s dream to represent Zimbabwe at the world’s most prestigious swimming gala in the 50m and 100m backstroke events will be shattered if she fails to raise US$3 000 for her airfares and accommodation. The event will see top swimmers from more than 39 countries worldwide that include Australia, United States of America and South Africa battle for silverware. The talented 15-year-old swimmer recently made waves in the South African National Junior Championships after breaking a 21-year national junior record set by Kirsty Coventry in the 100m backstroke. She set the new time of 1.05.60 seconds on her way to the gold medal.
