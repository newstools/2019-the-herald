The Herald LONDON. — Maurizio Sarri has requested Chelsea release him from his contract in order for him to take charge at Italian Serie A football champions Juventus. The Italian has reportedly reached an agreement to become the Serie A champions’ next head coach. Fali Ramadani, Sarri’s agent, met with Chelsea management on Saturday to discuss his client’s future. According to Goal, the Chelsea boss received an offer from Juventus that would pay him £6m-per-year to succeed Massimiliano Allegri. Allegri recently announced his intention to step down at the end of the season after leading the Bianconeri to five successive Scudettos. Sarri won the first trophy of his managerial career on Wednesday as he led Chelsea to Europa League glory. The Stamford Bridge outfit outclassed Arsenal in Baku, running out 4-1 winners thanks in part to Eden Hazard’s brace. But just 12 months into his reign, Sarri now looks set to quit Chelsea to head back to Serie A. The Blues are targeting a new manager before giving the green light for the 60-year-old to leave. Chelsea legend and current Derby boss Frank Lampard is expected to be one of the favourites for the soon-to-be-vacant role. — The Daily Star.
