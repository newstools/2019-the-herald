The Herald BIRMINGHAM. — The Proteas, almost certainly out of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, will do a lot of soul searching in the days and weeks to follow. Wednesday’s four-wicket loss to New Zealand at Edgbaston means that Faf du Plessis and his men have lost four of their six matches at the tournament. There was a washed-out “no result” against the West Indies, while a win over lowly Afghanistan is all the South Africans have to show for their efforts so far in England. It is, quite easily, South Africa’s worst ever performance at a Cricket World Cup.
The anger from back home is something that Du Plessis anticipates and understands, but supporters of this team will want answers. Where did it all go wrong?
South Africa never entered the competition as favourites, but they were still heavily fancied to make a semi-final and were certainly not expected to struggle as much as they have done. Injuries were obviously disruptive, but they do not excuse the performances that have been dished up over the last three weeks.
All the talk pre-tournament from the Proteas had centred around their fast bowling attack. That was to be their major weapon and, according to Du Plessis and coach Ottis Gibson, was their ticket to the World Cup final. — AFP.
