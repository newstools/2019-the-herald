The Herald Gold prices remained subdued yesterday after retreating from a 14-month peak in the previous session, as the dollar held near multi-week highs on strong US retail sales data, ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting this week. Spot gold was down 0,2 percent at $1,338.86 per ounce as of 0549 GMT, after hitting $1,358.04, its highest since April 11, 2018, on Friday. US gold futures were down 0,2 percent at $1,343.90 an ounce. “For now, gold prices are holding tight. The markets have aggressively priced in rate-cut expectations and trade uncertainties have boosted safe-haven assets,” said Benjamin Lu, an analyst with Singapore-based Phillip Futures. Expectations of an interest rate cut at the Fed’s June 18-19 meeting fell to 21,7 percent from 28,3 percent on Thursday, in the wake of the strong retail data, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. However, bets for monetary easing at the July meeting remain high at 85 percent. Weighing on bullion’s appeal was the stronger dollar, which is holding near a two-week high on Monday, supported by strong US retail sales data, analysts said. US retail sales increased in May and sales for the prior month were revised higher, suggesting a pick-up in consumer spending that could ease fears the economy was slowing down sharply in the second quarter. Meanwhile, US Trade Representative’s Office on Monday will kick off seven days of testimony from U.S. retailers, manufacturers and other businesses about President Donald Trump’s plan to hit another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods with tariffs. — Reuters.
