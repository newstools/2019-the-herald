The Herald LONDON. — Frank Lampard will start work as Chelsea manager next week on a three-year deal worth £5,5 million a year — the same as predecessor Maurizio Sarri. Blues legend Lampard has found the prospect of leading the English Premiership football club where he played for 13 years too tempting to resist and Derby will not stand in his way. The Rams on Tuesday gave permission for Chelsea to approach Lamps for discussions. The first wave of Chelsea’s first-team squad report back for pre-season training a week on Friday. But Lampard will be at the club’s training complex early next week to start the groundwork as the tenth permanent boss in 16 years to serve under owner Roman Abramovich. The fine details of the deal are still being worked out, but there are no anticipated hitches to what will be a bold move. Lampard has been a manager for only one season at Championship side Derby.— The Sun.
