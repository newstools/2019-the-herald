Speaking during the handover and takeover ceremony held at Headquarters Mechanised Brigade at Inkomo Barracks last week, Lt-Gen Chimonyo said Government was aware of the challenges faced by its workers and was working on addressing them. “. . . I am aware of the logistical challenges the organisation is facing as a result of illegal sanctions imposed by the erstwhile colonisers . . . The Government is working to improve the general conditions of service for both the civil service and our armed and security forces and we all need to be patient,” said Lt-Gen Chimonyo. “For troops, you are aware that determination to wait is a key skill required in your daily operations. Besides the numerous challenges you are facing in your workplace, I am aware of your ultimate sacrifice as well as your loyalty and dedication to the Republic of Zimbabwe. “In that regard, we are fully committed to regularly review and improve your conditions of service as the country’s economy improves.” Outgoing commander of Mechanised Brigade, Brigadier-General Steven Gwekwerere officially handed over command responsibilities to Colonel Themba Bvunzai Mlambo.
