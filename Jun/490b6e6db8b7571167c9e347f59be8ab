THE Judicial Service Commission has scored a first by employing more females in fulfilment of Government’s thrust of women empowerment, Chief Justice Luke Malaba has said. He said JSC’s female staff complement stood at more than 53 percent as it demonstrated resolve to ensure gender parity in line with Government’s vision. Chief Justice Malaba said this in his 2018 JSC annual report tabled in Parliament recently by Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi. “More notably JSC may have in the course of the year set a national record as the first public institution to employ more females than males. The ration of females to males in the Commission now stands at 53, 6 percent to 46, 4 percent,” he said. On the bench, Justice Elizabeth Gwaunza is the Deputy Chief Justice. Female justices include Rita Makarau, Susan Mavhangira and Lavendar Makoni. There are also several female judges at the High Court notably among them is Justice Priscilla Chigumba who is the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission chair. JSC is currently constituted by three female commissioners who are Justice Gwaunza, Mrs Sekai Madzonga and Mrs Priscilla Mutembwa. On conditions of service for judges, Justice Malaba said they were still making frantic efforts to secure foreign currency to procure their service vehicles.
