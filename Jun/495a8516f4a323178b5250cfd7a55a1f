The Herald NEW YORK. — The president of the Confederation of Africa Football Ahmad Ahmad has been accused of sexual harassment a day after he was released by the French Police on Friday. A public relation consultant from Mali, Mariam Diakite, told The New York Times that she was fired by Ahmad for rejecting his advances. Diakite (34) said she had confrontation with Ahmad in a hotel suite during a conference she was hired to organise in Rabat, Morocco, in 2017. She stated that Ahmad informed her he was terminating her appointment because he had informed officials that they were in a romantic relationship, and that it would be a conflict of interest if she carried on working. “He (Ahmad) was refusing to let me work because I refused to marry him,” Diakite was quoted as saying by The New York Times. — The New York Times
