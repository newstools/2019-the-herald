The Herald RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazilian football star Neymar will miss the Copa America in Brazil after suffering an injury in a warm-up game against Qatar. The Paris Saint-Germain forward was forced off after just 21 minutes of the game with an apparent right ankle injury. He was then seen crying on the bench before being helped down the tunnel and into the dressing room. Neymar was replaced by Everton Soares in the Brazil lineup and the CBF has confirmed he has suffered a twisted ankle and will not be fit for the Copa America. The 27-year-old has only recently recovered from a foot injury, having missed 13 games in Ligue 1 between January and March. He netted 23 goals in all competitions for PSG as they retained their Ligue 1 crown. Brazil had opened up a lead just moments before Neymar’s injury, with Richarlison providing the game’s first goal in the 16th minute on an assist from Dani Alves. Just moments after his departure, Brazil scored again, with Gabriel Jesus firing on home with Richarlison playing provider this time around. The match was a warm-up tie ahead of the upcoming tournament, which will be held in Brazil. In a statement, the Brazilian Confederation of Football confirmed the star would miss the tournament. “After suffering a sprain in his right ankle during Wednesday’s game against Qatar, Neymar was evaluated and subjected to complementary imaging tests that confirmed ligament rupture in the ankle,” the statement read. “Due to the seriousness of the injury, Neymar will not have the physical conditions and sufficient recovery time to participate in the Copa América Brasil 2019. “As of this Thursday (06), the technical committee of the Brazilian National Team will begin the definition of a substitute.” — AFP
