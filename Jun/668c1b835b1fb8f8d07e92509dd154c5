The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter CRANBORNE Bullets coach Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera is keeping a low profile in as far as the championship race is concerned in the ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League. Saruchera’s team opened a nine-point lead with a 2-0 win over Grain Tigers at GMB Aspindale on Saturday as second-placed Black Mambas suffered a shock 2-0 defeat away to Banket United. Saruchera,  whose side got their goals through Yusuf Yasili and Nyasha Munhira on either side of the half, said it was too early to speak of winning the championship race as they are still to reach the halfway mark. “The Northern Region Division One League is very competitive and anything can happen, so we cannot talk of the championship yet.”
