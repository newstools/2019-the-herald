The Herald PARIS. — To death and taxes being life’s only two certainties can be added a third — Rafael Nadal winning the French Open tennis title. The Spaniard secured a 12th title at Roland Garros with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 victory over Dominic Thiem yesterday and 18th major of his career. He now has 93 match wins on Paris’ famous crushed red brick against just two defeats in 14 years. Roger Federer, who suffered his worst loss at a Slam in 11 years at the hands of the world number two in the semi-finals, said: “There is nobody who even plays remotely close to Rafa. “I don’t even know who I need to go search for to go practice with somebody who plays like him.” However, you will never hear Nadal indulge in any similar self-praise. Just as happy fishing or playing golf in Mallorca, Nadal is ruthless on the tennis court but disarmingly humble off it. — AFP.
