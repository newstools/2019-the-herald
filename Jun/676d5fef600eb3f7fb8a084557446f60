The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — South Africa’s rand was little changed early yesterday, with investors looking ahead to a local inflation report and a United States decision on interest rates. At 0645 GMT the rand was up 0,14 percent at 14,7900 per dollar from its close of 14,8075 in the previous session, taking most of its direction from Asian currencies. The US Federal Reserve concludes a two-day meeting tomorrow and is expected to lay the groundwork for a rate cut later this year. That would probably increase demand for emerging-market currencies as investors look for higher- yielding assets. With no economic data due yesterday and the 14,60 technical resistance level a long way off, the rand is set to trade in a narrow range before today’s release of local consumer price figures. “If, as we suspect, inflation prints below 4,5 percent for a seventh consecutive month, it will solidify our view for a July cut, with the SARB now signalling its willingness to become more accommodative in response to inflation outcomes,” Rand Merchant Bank’s Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana said in a note. Bonds were also steady, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond down 1 basis point to 8,37 percent.
