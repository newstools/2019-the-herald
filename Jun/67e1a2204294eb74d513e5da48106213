THE Harare Chapter of the Dynamos supporters will tomorrow hold the second edition of the DeMbare Nine memorial football tournament at Widdicombe Primary School in Hatfield. Patrice Muzondiwa, the Dynamos Harare Chapter’s organising secretary, said the main aim of the event is to fundraise for the families of the club’s nine supporters, who died in a road accident on their way to Gweru to watch their team’s match against Chapungu on June 11, 2016, as well as uniting local football fans. Tomorrow’s social football tournament will have six teams made up of FC Comrades, Magaffer, Dynamos Supporters, CAPS United Supporters and Highlanders Supporters. “We started this initiative last year when we held the tournament at Morris Depot and we managed to give the families of the late supporters some food hampers so it is an ongoing thing which we are going to do again this year.
“We are happy that some clubs have heard of our plight and they are willing to take part in this social football event which is a welcome move. There is need for support for the families of the late supporters and we are grateful to some people who have since started supporting the children left behind by paying their fees. “There will be a lot of activities as well but our intention will be to fundraise for these families,” said Muzondiwa.
The tournament starts at 10am.
