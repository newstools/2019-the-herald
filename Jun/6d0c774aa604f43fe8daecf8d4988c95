Most health centres in the country are set for a major facelift after Government entered into an agreement with development partners that will see completion of unfinished clinics, Senate has heard. Health and Child Care Minister Dr Obadiah Moyo said development partners were keen to complete construction of health centres and his Ministry had started collecting information on affected health centres. Dr Moyo said this in Senate last Thursday, during a question and answer session. Senator Chief Nhema had enquired on Government policy on clinics and hospitals that would be constructed, but would take years before they were operational. “I have just come from a meeting, funny enough, where I have been discussing with a group that wants to assist us to complete all these clinics. Within the next few days, we shall be requesting for information about clinics that are incomplete which we can use as part of our primary health care in the rural areas. That is what we are emphasising right now. It would be very helpful if we could get that information and give it to some partners who are willing to assist us to finalise these clinics,” said Minister Moyo. “We want this as part of our universal coverage where we will be able to ensure that everyone has access to a hospital or to a clinic.”
