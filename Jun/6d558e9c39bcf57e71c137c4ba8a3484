The Herald LOS ANGELES — The lawsuit against Juventus and Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo was quietly dropped last month, after his accuser filed a notice of voluntary dismissal to the Nevada state court in Las Vegas. The accusations against Ronaldo made headlines at the beginning of the season, leading to a 15 percent drop in Juventus shares and prompting the star to vehemently deny any notion of wrongdoing. Katheryn Mayorga (34) filed a complaint against Ronaldo on September 27, claiming that she was sexually assaulted by the Portuguese international at his penthouse suite in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. She went on to allege that while she agreed to a settlement at the time, she wasn’t emotionally competent to participate in the mediation. According to Bloomberg, the filing for dismissal didn’t include any information regarding whether Ronaldo had reached a settlement with his accuser that led to the dismissal of the lawsuit. Neither Ronaldo’s nor Mayorga’s lawyer have issued statements on the termination of the saga. Contrary to the report, Rafael Buschmann, a correspondent for Der Spiegel — the publication that first published the allegations against the former Real Madrid star — claimed that the saga is not yet over, it has just been moved to a different court. “The case is not closed, it is just at a different court now. After it was not possible for Mayorga’s lawyers to serve Ronaldo with the complaint, they filed it at a federal court,” he tweeted. The charges against Ronaldo were severe enough to lead his club Juventus to cancel their plans to participate in the International Champions Cup in the US this summer, to prevent any risk that the Portuguese star would be questioned or detained by authorities. — AFP.
