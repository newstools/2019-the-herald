THE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) has called for an increase of trade in elephant products, as it seeks to deal with overpopulation in game parks and create a balance in the ecosystem. Zimparks director-general Mr Fulton Mangwanya recently said overpopulation in the country’s game parks was a cause for concern and increased trade would be the starting point to restoring normalcy. Zimbabwe has the second largest number of elephants globally. “Zimbabwe has an ecological capacity of 55 000 elephants, but recent statistics revealed that the country has over 84 000 elephants, posing huge threat to other species habitats,” he said. “We need to balance the ecosystem.” Mr Mangwanya said the increase in elephant trade would ensure revenue needed for operational costs. “We need to buy conservation equipment which will help in protecting these animals,” he said. “Our source of money can come from the utilisation of the resources we already have. “Ivory in particular will generate adequate funds for us to purchase vehicles, firearms, drones, helicopters, and address the shortage of game rangers since we will be able to recruit more. This will address poaching as well.” Mr Mangwanya said Zimbabwe had a conservation strategy in place, which called for sustainable utilisation of resources. “The international community should know that we believe in sustainable utilisation of resources, especially wildlife resources,” he said. “We have a working management and conservation plan, that is why we currently have a lot of elephants. “The ‘do not touch attitude’ is not applicable to us, we will increase elephant trade to create a balanced ecological system and to make money, which will benefit local communities as well.”
