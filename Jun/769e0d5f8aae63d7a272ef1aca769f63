THE Gems got another confidence-booster ahead of their World Cup participation after Australia’s Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Bronte Moules, hosted a reception for the team on Monday. The Ambassador said the function was meant to celebrate and recognise the team’s achievements. “When we had that the Zimbabwe Gems, Zimbabwe women’s netball team, had qualified for the World Cup that is coming up next month we were delighted for them,’’ Moules said. “We recognise what an achievement this was and how much hard work must have gone into this achievement and what incredible standards of sportsmanship. “Firstly, we thought maybe we can support this in some way and, secondly, we wanted to celebrate it. “The reasons were two-fold, one is that in Australia we love sport, two we are a sporting nation, so we recognised that achievement.’’ Zimbabwe are up against Australia in Group A. The other teams in the group are Sri Lanka and Northern Ireland. “The second thing is we are always looking for ways to get messages out about gender equality, women and girls empowerment. “And, we think that sport diplomacy, showcasing the achievements of women in sport, is a great way to send that message to young girls and young boys that girls can do anything. “So, we are giving clothing for the whole team and we then also wanted to have this reception tonight to celebrate and acknowledge that achievement and, hopefully, give them some encouragement.’’ The Gems’ captain Perpetua Siyachitema said this will go a long way in raising their morale. “I think they have boosted our confidence, the morale is now high. I think we feel that we are geared up for the games and I am so excited that, at least, people now know about us,” said Siyachitema. Yesterday the team received a first aid kit from Diamond Pharmacy. Diamond Pharmacy director George Nyamayaro urged the players to continue working hard and challenged other corporates to come on board and provide support.
