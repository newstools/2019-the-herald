The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United have opened talks with Spanish football giants Real Madrid over the sale of Paul Pogba. SunSport can reveal the Spanish giants met with United officials last week when they were in London to complete the signing of Chelsea’s Eden Hazard. Real president Florentino Perez will now weigh up whether to meet United’s £150 million asking price for the 26-year-old France midfielder. Unsettled Pogba is next on boss Zinedine Zidane’s hit-list — to play in a deeper role. But United want a profit on the £89m they paid Juventus three years ago. Harry Maguire is a summer target for both Manchester giants. But there are fears Leicester could price him out of a move by demanding £80 million — a world- record fee for a defender. Manchester City chief Pep Guardiola needs to replace Vincent Kompany. — The Sun.
