The Herald LONDON. — European football champions Liverpool are ready to hand Jurgen Klopp a bumper new deal to secure his future at Anfield long term. The manager won his first trophy with the Reds on Saturday as they were crowned champions of Europe. Tottenham had no answer to Liverpool’s dominance at the Wanda Metropolitano as they prevailed 2-0 victors in Madrid. It ended a wait of more than seven years for silverware at Anfield with their last trophy coming in the Carabao Cup back in 2012. Klopp has worked wonders at Liverpool since replacing Brendan Rodgers in the dugout in October 2015. He had led the Reds to two European finals in advance of Saturday’s triumph but suffered defeat in the 2016 Europa League final against Sevilla and then last year in the Champions League final against Real Madrid. However, ex-Borussia Dortmund boss Klopp, who also suffered heartache in the 2013 European final with his old club against Bayern Munich, finally got his hands on the trophy. The Reds’ incredible battle with Manchester City for the Premier League title also showed the club are in good hands under his leadership. And owners Fenway Sports Group have decided the 51-year-old is the man to lead them forward for years to come. Klopp’s current deal at Anfield is due to expire in 2022, meaning it has three years left to run. But it is understood FSG are keen to tie the manager down to a new, extended contract. He earns £7m-a-year at the moment, which is the same as West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini and less than half of the £15.3m-a-year Pep Guardiola receives at rivals City. His personal terms will subsequently change if a new deal is agreed. And according to the Daily Mail, FSG are ready to offer Klopp a salary of £10m-a-year. That would be an increase of £3m annually for Klopp, who fans will believe deserves the recognition for his work at Liverpool. — The Daily Star.
