HARARE City chairman Alois Masepe says their partnership with English Championship side Nottingham Forest will benefit their junior policy development. The partnership was initiated by the former’s British coach, Mark Harrison, who hails from Derby, a city close to Nottingham. The twinning has already started delivering results, with Nottingham Forest having already put aside equipment for the Harare City’s academy. Harare City juniors coaches are also set to go for attachment at the English side towards the commencement of the new season in August. “We believe that our vision as Harare City will now be well complimented with the twinning arrangement with Nottingham Forest,’’ said Masepe. “We are aware that Zimbabwe is suffering severely from talent drain and we have sought to plug that by pooling all talented juniors into the Harare City system. “We know that as they progress, we will not be able to absorb all of them into our senior team, but others will then be able to join other teams, who are unfortunately always rebuilding at the start of every season. “We are happy that the Nottingham Forest deal comes in at a time like this and it has its main thrust on junior development. “With the junior league coming next year, the deal wouldn’t have come at the right time.’ Harare City have roped in two schools, Waddilove High in Marondera and Rufaro in Masvingo, where they second some of their junior players.
