THE Zimbabwe senior netball team resumed their build-up for the World Cup next month in Liverpool, England, with coach Lloyd Makunde saying they are now in the final stages of their preparations. Zimbabwe will be making their maiden appearance at the world competition and will be hoping to leave a mark at the global event scheduled for July 12 to 21 with 16 countries competing. The Gems got down to business yesterday at the Stodart Netball Complex in Mbare and Makunde said they now need to fine-tune their team. “We are now working on shaping the team and polishing it. We now want to come up with the final team so we need to come up with the 12 players. We are on course. As I have said before, we have no specific areas that we are targeting but we are working on all areas, trying to improve on our weaknesses and fine-tuning those areas we have been doing well to ensure we up our game. “Since we do not have height we will compensate with speed and jumps so those are some of the aspects we are working on,” said Makunde. Makunde said he is happy with the attitude of the team with the players giving their best. “The players are very positive after our games in South Africa, everyone is giving their best so that we win some games,” said Makunde. At the World Cup Zimbabwe will face Australia, Northern Ireland and Sri Lanka in Group A.
