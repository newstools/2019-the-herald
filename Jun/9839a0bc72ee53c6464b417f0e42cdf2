THE senior national rugby team captain Denford Mutamangira, who has crossed paths with the Zimbabwe Rugby Union over his call to have former coach Peter De Villiers reinstated, has taken his fight a step further after he called on the union’s board to be dissolved. Mutamangira was last week stripped of his captaincy and is due to appear before the disciplinary committee for the social media utterances he made without ZRU’s authorisation. South African De Villiers was sacked after he delayed his return to the country with five days attending to his cancer-stricken daughter. The former Sables skipper maintained he was still the captain as there was no formal communication from the union. He said he heard about his fate through social media. Mutangamira yesterday addressed a heated Press conference where he was accompanied by former rugby administrators and fitness trainers Temba Mliswa and Gerald Maguranyanga, as well as four senior players, who stood in solidarity with their captain against the Aaron Jani-led ZRU executive. “I show no apology as the ZRU has degenerated to unacceptable levels and in order for us to retrieve a resemblance of respect and pride in the sport, urgent intervention is required.”
