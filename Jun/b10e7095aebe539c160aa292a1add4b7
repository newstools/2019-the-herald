PHYSICAL Disability T20 cricket team’s fund-raising general manager Tendai “T-Buns” Zhakata said they are looking forward to host a fund-raising dinner dance for the team to successfully attend the matches in England from August 2. The team, which has 21 delegates, still have a lot to cover as some of the players are still awaiting their passports from the Registrar-General’s Office. Zhakata, who has successfully led another campaign for the Homeless World Cup team before, said he is happy with his new role and will work flat-out to see that they raise the required funds for the cricket team’s trip to UK.
They are aiming fund-raise about US$66 000 for the team.
