The Herald LONDON — Neymar is wanted back at Spanish football champions Barcelona by Lionel Messi, who would reportedly prefer a deal for the Brazil international over one for Antoine Griezmann this summer. Neymar’s time at PSG could be drawing to a close with talk rife that he wants to make a stunning return to Barcelona this summer. Two years ago, the Brazil international caused outrage at the Nou Camp by choosing to turn his back on the Catalan giants. Neymar opted to leave Barcelona after growing tired of always being overshadowed by Messi, despite the duo being close. Fast-forward to now and the La Liga giants are likely to splash out on at least one big name this summer. Barcelona are understood to have an interest in Atletico Madrid hitman Antoine Griezmann. But Barcelona’s interest in Griezmann has cooled amid opposition against his signing at board level and in the dressing room at Camp Nou, with Messi and others favouring the return of Neymar this summer. Messi was asked about the possibility of Barca buying the Atletico Madrid attacker in May last year and said: “I don’t know if there is anything in it or not, but we are delighted if the best players come and Griezmann is one of those.” But a year on, the Argentine gave a very different answer. Speaking in the pre-match press conference ahead of the Copa del Rey final defeat against Valencia on May 25, he was asked again about the French forward and said: “I won’t speak about Griezmann.” That was after the 28-year-old had announced his decision to leave Atletico, paving the way for a summer switch to Barca. — The Evening Standard.
