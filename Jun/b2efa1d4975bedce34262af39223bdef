The Herald Oprah Winfrey admits that there are times she misses her beloved talk show. It’s been more than eight years since the final episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show aired, and she confessed to ET Canada’s Cheryl Hickey that she has thought about a reboot. “I would love to make that happen, let me tell you. But maybe not every day,” Winfrey confided. “For 25 years, it was perfect.” The 65-year-old Queen of Talk added, “The only time I missed it was during the election or when something really big happens in the news. I think, ‘Oh, gee, I wish I had a show.’” Winfrey was in Toronto, Canada, promoting her new book, “The Path Made Clear: Discovering Your Life’s Direction and Purpose”, and recalled one of her first “aha” moments. “My path became clear the moment, I remember it actually, when I flew into Chicago,” she shared. “I thought, ‘If the show isn’t successful, then I’m going to go into advertising.’” Now, Winfrey is hoping to help fans find their path. All of the proceeds from her book will go to the Boys and Girls Club of Attala County, Mississippi, where she grew up. — Toronto
