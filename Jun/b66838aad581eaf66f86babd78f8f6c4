OVER 200 Zimbabweans from the Marshal Gore-led Daspora community are expected to touch down in Cairo this evening to rally behind the Warriors ahead of their AFCON opener against hosts Egypt at the Cairo International Stadium tomorrow night. The Diaspora fans will only leave to their respective bases at the stage the Warriors will crash out. Team Zimbabwe UK chief executive and head of Diaspora delegation Gore, said the mobilisation of Diaspora supporters was been a huge success. Speaking from Egypt yesterday, Gore said he had to work overtime to secure desired numbers for the trip. “I’m so delighted that people have responded overwhelmingly to this call. “I would like to salute all the Diaspora supporters who have sacrificed financially to come and rally behind the Warriors.  They’ve demonstrated their patriotism,” said Gore. “We are fully behind the national team at this AFCON. We believe they have now come of age and they will make us proud. “It’s a feel-good factor to be Zimbabweans though we live in the Diaspora. “We have a burning desire to see the team doing well at events like these. This is the ultimate football contest on the continent and we believe Zimbabwe are good enough to wrestle for the ultimate prize.”
