BAD BOYS, Chegutu Pirates, have been suspended from using Pfupajena, with immediate effect, following cases of violence by their supporters. This decision, passed by the Northern Region Soccer league management committee, comes into effect for the Week 11 fixtures this weekend pending the club’s appearance before the disciplinary committee. The NRSL management committee resolved that Chegutu Pirates’ home matches will be played at an alternative venue until the case has been finalised. They are set to take on Black Mambas tomorrow. League chairman, Willard Manyengavana, said this was taken as a precaution to ensure the safety of the visiting players and match officials. “It is on record that already two incidents of violence have been recorded during Chegutu Pirates’ home matches,’’ he said. “This kind of behaviour has no place in our football. “As a league, we have been forced to take swift action, in line with our statutes, against Chegutu Pirates, and protect the related members of the family of football from any harm of any kind, pending their appearance before the disciplinary committee.’’ Chegutu Pirates are already sitting on a suspended sentence from previous disciplinary committee judgments. “Cases of violence from crowd trouble are ugly in their nature and cannot be treated with kids’ gloves,’’ said Manyengavana. “As the league, we will continue to apply the full wrath of our regulatory framework and ensure we will rid the league of any undesirable elements.’’ The suspension comes barely hours after the team had their match against Kariba Waves abandoned at Nyamhunga this week.
