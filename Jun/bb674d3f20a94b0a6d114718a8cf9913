The omnibus driver suddenly applied brakes resulting in the truck driver swerving to the right to avoid hitting it. This resulted in a head on collision with another kombi that was going the opposite direction,” he said. Asst Comm Nyathi said 16 people died on the spot while the other three died on admission to a hospital. More details to follow.
