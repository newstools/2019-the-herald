FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza says he needs proven goal-getters for his men to return to their ruthless best.
The former Warriors coach has seen his men scoring a not-so-convincing 12 goals in 11 Premiership football matches this season, being outscored by six teams in the top tier so far. And Mapeza said he is definitely going to bring more attacking potency in his team when the mid-season transfer window opens, and is already running the ruler on two Nigerians and a Zambian. “We have to, we have some guys who are here on trials, they came here on Tuesday and we are still assessing them.
“But I have to be honest with you, we need someone to bang in those goals, not only one player, but maybe two players. “Someone in the calibre of Rodwell (Chinyengetere) . . . It is not easy to find someone like that but those are the type of players we need because we have been creating opportunities,” he said. The champions currently have last season’s second top goalscorer Lameck Nhamo, who joined from Triangle, and Cameroonian Albert Eonde at their disposal. There are also veteran legs of Mkokheli Dube and Charles Sibanda but Mapeza is looking elsewhere to address the team’s goal-scoring weakness. Addressing his routine weekly media briefing ahead of their league game against Bulawayo Chiefs, Mapeza says goal-scoring is their only challenge.
