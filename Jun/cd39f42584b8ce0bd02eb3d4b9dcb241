The Herald PARIS. — Newly-crowned French Open champion Ashleigh Barty said that she did not imagine winning a Grand Slam title “at all” when she took a break from tennis in 2014 to play cricket. The Australian played for the Brisbane Heat in the Women’s Big Bash League four years ago, before returning to tennis ranked 683 in the world. But she continued her incredible rise on Saturday by thrashing Czech teenager Marketa Vondrousova 6-1, 6-3 in the Roland Garros final to lift her maiden major trophy. “No, not at all,” she said of her hopes of winning a Grand Slam when she started her comeback. “I think maybe in doubles, if I’m being completely honest. I think I was so close with Casey (Dellacqua) so many times. I felt maybe that was a possibility. “But I think a new perspective in my life and in my career, it’s brought this new belief, I suppose, and this feeling of belonging at the very top level. — AFP.
