One of the longest surviving rhumba ensembles in the country, BV Labien Musica, has appointed Lloyd Boora as its new logistics manager. Boora is not new to the entertainment industry as he has previously worked with Gary Tight. He is also an actor and appeared in the popular local television soapie Wenera. In an interview with the group president Eugene Muronzi, popularly known as T-bass, he said they are hoping the coming in of the new logistics manager will develop the group in various aspects. “We are hoping our new manager will improve the band through marketing, advertising on social media, helping to find shows to perform among others. In fact, he will uplift the band to keep on progressing in entertaining our fans. “BV Labien Musica is one of the consistent rhumba groups in the country. The group has managed to stay firm despite the slump in rhumba popularity locally,” he said. Asked why he quit acting, Boora said he wanted to venture into music as he had a passion for it. “I love music. I promise to deliver as I already have something in the pipeline. Give me time and you see my prospects. People should expect singles, videos and collaborations. We are already cooking something as we speak. “I am going to work hard so that I do not disappoint or let down my new band. “The fact that they incorporated me as their logistics manager means a lot to me and them as they have entrusted me. In fact, it’s a great responsibility,” he said. The band has more than six albums and they last released a danceable three-track album titled “Ndosaka Extended Play”. Tracks on the project included “Mamero”, “Yellow Bone” and “Zvipo”. It seems the album is what local rhumba fans were waiting for judging from the overwhelming response it received when it was released.
