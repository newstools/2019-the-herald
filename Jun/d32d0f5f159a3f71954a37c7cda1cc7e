ZIMBABWE team coach for the FINA World Swimming Championships Debbie Wetzlar says her charges have covered a lot of ground in their preparations for the big event. The one-week event is slated for July 21 to 28 in Gwangju, South Korea, with approximately 2 300 athletes from 186 countries set to take part. Zimbabwe will be represented by four athletes. Wetzlar told The Herald yesterday that three of her swimmers that include the United States-based Peter Wetzlar, Liam Davis, who is based in the United Kingdom, and Australia-based Robyn Lee, were receiving intensive training from their international coaches abroad. Paige Van Der Westhuizen (16) will battle for silverware in the 100m and 200m freestyle events. The Chisipite senior school pupil is the current holder of the Zimbabwe Under-16 50m breaststroke record. Wetzlar said her team was ready for the challenge and their participation in one of the worldâ€™s most prestigious swimming events will act as an experience and platform for exposure for the swimmers. She confirmed that she will connect with the three in Seoul, South Korea, on July 18 and travel together to the host city Gwangju.
