The Herald Every employer who pays or grants any remuneration to an employee is required to deduct Employees Tax (PAYE) and remit it to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority within the periods given in terms of Section 73 as read with the Thirteenth Schedule of the Income Tax Act. What constitutes remuneration for employees’ tax purposes? The term “remuneration” covers a number of aspects which may be paid or granted  by the employer to any employee  as part of their conditions of employment and includes; any amount of income received by the  employee by way of salary, leave pay, allowance, wage, overtime pay, benefits or advantages, whether in cash or otherwise. The definition of remuneration also includes amounts received in the form of: Annuities  for services rendered Withdrawal from or winding up of a benefit, pension or unapproved fund An amount equal to the value of an advantage or benefit in respect of employment, service, office or other gainful occupation or in connection with the taking up or termination of employment, service, office or other gainful occupation. From the above, it should be highlighted that the term generally covers the majority of fringe benefits enjoyed by employees as part of their conditions of employment. What is excluded from remuneration? Amounts paid or payable to any person in the course of any trade conducted by him independently. An example is consultancy services or other business income.  However, commissions earned by insurance agents and estate agents constitute remuneration subject to PAYE. Any amount of director’s fees paid or payable to any individual by any company in respect of services rendered or to be rendered by such individual to such company if no other amounts constituting remuneration in terms of the definition given above  have been paid or become payable to such individual by such company.

Any amount which is paid or payable to a person by way of a commutation of a pension or annuity and which does not form part of that person’s gross income Any amount which the Commissioner-General directs or prescribes shall not be remuneration for the purposes of this Schedule.
