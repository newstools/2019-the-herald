Zimbabwe is hosting a Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) workshop to train security sector officials who will take part in regional peacekeeping missions. The workshop, which kicked off on Monday, will see participants being orientated in preparation for combined exercises. In his opening remarks, guest of honour Zimbabwe Defence Forces (Inspector-General), Major-General Kasirai Tazira said the “train the trainer” course was vital as it would equip members of the SADC Standby Brigade with requisite knowledge in defence. “It is a privilege and an honour to be amongst those selected and as such you must work hard and prove that you deserve this opportunity. “This course is important, if we are to achieve the goals of the SADC Standby Brigade and other peace keeping training exercises. This is the only way we can ensure that we harmonise the conduct of inspections to achieve a common understanding, coming from different backgrounds. “In SADC, we are committed to ensure that peace envelopes not only SADC, mother Africa, but indeed the whole world. “However, history has repeatedly shown us that peace will continually evade most parts of the globe,” he said.
