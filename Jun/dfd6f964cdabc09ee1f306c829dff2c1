ZIMBABWEAN professional golfers struggled in the opening round of the KCB Karen Masters at Karen Country Club in Nairobi, Kenya, yesterday. The Sunshine Tour co-sanctioned tournament had a good response from the local golfers with six of them taking part in this event ahead of the confirmed Zimbabwe Open. It was not a bed of roses for Ryan Cairns, Ben Follet-Smith, Mohammad Mandhu, Trainos Muradzikwa and Mark Williams, who all recorded over-par scores. Cairns was the best placed Zimbabwean after yesterday’s opening round as he carded a one-over par 73 going into today’s round where he will have an early tee off. Mandhu also stands a chance for a comeback in today’s decisive round as he is a stroke behind Cairns at two over while Follet-Smith, Muradzikwa and Williams’ chances are slim as they are on three, four and eight over respectively. Borrowdale Brooke-based Steven Ferreira is leading the tournament at 10 under after a very good round where he had five birdies, a single bogey and pars in the opening nine before he returned with four birdies, an eagle and three pars at the back nine. Ferreira is enjoying good form and has done well to open a five shots lead to second placed Garrick Higgo, Niel Schietekat, Thabiso Ngcobo and Greg Snow. The tournament is sponsored by the Commercial Bank of Kenya and boasts a prize purse of R2,2 million, which was increased from last year’s R2 million.
