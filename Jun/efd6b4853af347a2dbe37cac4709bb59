Zimbabwe coach, Edison Chiware, was delighted by his men’s performance. “We are, obviously, excited. I still maintain that the lads are putting in a huge effort and we are happy with what we are seeing and, hopefully, it will continue into the next games. “I think what we have observed with our team is we are shooting better than before, so this really gives us good opportunities because now we are spacing out well,” said Chiware.
