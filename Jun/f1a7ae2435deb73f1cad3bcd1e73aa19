The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter WITH just two weeks before the Copa Coca-Cola 15-and-Under boys and girls football tournament national finals, provinces are now set to finalise their representatives as the provincial finals roar into life today. The competition kicked-off last month with the zonal games, which were followed by the district competition. The provincial finals will determine each provinceâ€™s representative in the boys and girls sections at the national finals set for July 11 to 13. The winners from the provinces will join defending champions Pamushana and Nyamauru in the boys and girls categories as well as hosting schools in Kadoma where the national finals will take place. National Association of Secondary School Heads head-in-charge of football Tranos Mbwirire urged participating schools to ensure they field the correct age-group as they continue to urge schools against age-cheating.
