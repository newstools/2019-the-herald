Rated as one of the continent’s most sought-after events, the “Castle Lite Unlocks” music concert this year promises to be an outstanding hip-hop experience. Running from June 17-18, the edition is made up of a one-day hip-hop conference and the ultimate concert experience featuring American hip-hop sensation Post Malone, live in concert at the Ticket Pro Dome in Johannesburg, South Africa. “As the regional brand continues to grow and evolve, this year the brand unlocks a bigger, better experience for its loyal fans, as they will be immersed in all things hip-hop, culture, fashion and innovation in the ultimate two-day music experience,” noted organisers of event. “In May, Castle Lite Zimbabwe fans were given the opportunity to be part of the Unlocks Experience, as the brand hosted a series of three ‘Road to Unlocks’ events in Gweru, Bulawayo and Harare on a quest to find six lucky winners of the all-expenses paid VIP experience to Unlocks, courtesy of Castle Lite Zimbabwe, and we did so in our signature extra cold fashion.” The organisers said they will soon unveil the lucky winners. “As we draw closer to the event, be sure to tune into ZiFM our official radio partner, and follow our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/CastleLiteZimbabwe as we begin to unlock our six lucky winners. Watch their journey unfold as they build up to an experience of a lifetime with the coldest, most premium, and progressive brand around.”
