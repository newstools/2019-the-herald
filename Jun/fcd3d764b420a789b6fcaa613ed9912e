The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool will face a fight to keep hold of Champions League football final hero Mohamed Salah this summer, with Manchester United and Real Madrid battling to sign him. Spanish newspaper AS claim the giants both want to lure the Egyptian away from Anfield, while Bayern Munich are also keen to bring him to the Bundesliga. Salah scored from the penalty spot as Jurgen Klopp’s men defeated Tottenham 2-0 on Saturday night to claim their sixth European Cup. Asked about next season after lifting the trophy, Salah refused to commit himself to Liverpool. He said: “Now I cannot talk about my future.” AS say that Real failed with an attempt to sign the former Roma star last summer after Liverpool demanded more than £180m for him. But with Zinedine Zidane embarking on a huge rebuilding project at the Bernabeu, they are now even more determined to bring a player of his quality to Madrid. Speaking about Salah earlier in the season, Zidane said: “He’s a great player, he showed in Rome and he does now in Liverpool. “He’s young and keeps growing, he can give even more to football, he’s a player that I really appreciate.” Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be given money to spend after another disappointing season for United, but he faces a huge task to convince Salah to move to Liverpool’s fierce rivals. — Mailonline.
