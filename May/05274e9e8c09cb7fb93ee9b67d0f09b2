Government is working on the recruitment of 1 600 health workers following approval by Cabinet to establish at least 10 rural health centres per district in line with Government’s vision to improve primary healthcare. Primary healthcare is the foundation to the global health agenda of universal health coverage. Speaking at the 72nd Session of the World Health Assembly underway in Geneva, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Obadiah Moyo said the country was looking forward to constructing at least 10 health posts in each district, with a special focus on rural areas. “The Assembly may recall that Zimbabwe made some commitments last year, with regards to establishment of health posts. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that construction has begun on four health posts in front runner districts. “Our Government has plans to build 10 additional health posts in each of our 63 districts focusing on remote areas,” said Dr Moyo. Director of policy planning in the health ministry, Mr Stephen Banda echoed the Minister’s sentiments adding that the ministry was currently liaising with Treasury for concurrence to recruit 1 600 health professionals.
