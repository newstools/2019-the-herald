FORMER Hwange striker Allan Tavarwisa returned to haunt his former paymasters as his well-taken 65th minute goal made all the difference as visiting Chapungu United prevailed over the hosts in this Castle Lager Premier League football match at the Colliery yesterday. It was Hwange’s first loss at home this season with their only other demise coming at the hands of defending champions FC Platinum at Mandava in what has been a remarkable start in the top-flight league. A swift counter-attack by the airmen against the run of play saw a long ball being flighted from the centre circle and fell into the path of stocky Tavarwisa who beat defender Gerald Ndlovu for pace before hammering past an out drawn Taimon Mvula to seal Hwange’s fate. After the defeat Hwange will be the first to admit that games are won by scoring goals as they could have raced out of sight by the end of the opening half but they fluffed an avalanche of chances that came their way. Young midfielder Ted Ncube, thrown into the fray ahead of another youngster Arlton Ndlovu, blazed his effort over the bar from a good position in the 10th minute as Hwange’s tale of missed chances began. Chapungu only showed their sting in the last 10 minutes of the opening half with two quick chances that fell to Nigel Hunga who was denied first by a heroic one hand save by Mvula in the 37th minute before his free header on the brink of half-time agonisingly sailed over the crossbar.
