ZIMBABWE sprinters Ngoni Makusha and Tatenda Tsumba are eyeing qualification for the World Championships in Doha, this September. They have made it top priority to finish in the top eight when they race at the World Relay in Japan in a week’s time. The World Relay team leaves this Wednesday for Yokohama. The IAAF World Relays will be held from May 11 to 12 in the East Asian country. And the promising sprinters, representing the country for the first time at such a platform, are also aiming to finish in the top eight and book a ticket to Qatar for the Championships that will run from September 27 to October 6. With Zimbabwe currently number seven in the world, they believe the Doha dream can become a reality, too, just like the Yokohama international meet which they booked in style with a strong performance in Gaborone, Botswana. They posted a national record of 38.95 seconds in the 4x100m at the Ngoni Lefika Athletics Club Relays and Hurdles Event. Makusha, who is the anchor of the 4x100m team, says they are confident. “It feels great, it hasn’t been done in Zimbabwe, it’s something new to us so we are very happy,’’ he said. “You should expect a good performance from us, obviously, we have been working hard, preparing for this. “We are so excited and confident that we will produce a good result there. “Surely, we want to beat the national record again and our wish is to make it to the top eight and qualify for the World Championships in Doha and if we can get a podium finish that’s our goal.’’
