Upcoming gospel musician Mawamba Bunjira who recently released his debut single “Handidzokere Shure” says he is overwhelmed by the response to his work. In an interview, the musician said the future is looking bright considering that many people are loving his latest single. “I am bit overwhelmed by how my first offering has been received on different musical platforms. This has given more motivation to work on more songs which I will be releasing during the course of the year. “With hard work, good skills and support from my fans my brand will get more popular,” he said. “Handidzokere Shure” is a song that has raggae feel, making it more appealing to the youngsters. It was recorded at Harmony Music Studios and produced by Cornelius Mponda. The song is a reflection of how one used to live in darkness before receiving Christ and thanks grace of God for locating him and confesses that he will not turn back. The 35-year old artiste said he was working on the video of this track. “Currently I am working on the video which will be out soon and I hope fans will enjoy it. I am also working towards having my own band,” he said. Bunjira said he gets inspiration from church teachings to compose his songs and also draws inspiration from social issues that affect people in the society. Bunjira has been passionate about music since his childhood but got exposed to bigger platforms when he won a provincial musical competition. “I started singing when I was very young but my talented was exposed in public domain in 2008. “This is when I contested at the International Music Crossroads Provincial Competition in Chinhoyi and came up on number one out of 32 various musical groups,” he said.
