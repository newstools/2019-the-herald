The Herald DAR ES SALAAM. — Tanzanian President John Magufuli on Wednesday told public servants to be patient over salary rise and focus on development projects aimed at making the country prosperous. “When the economy thrives, the people’s well-being will also flourish than keeping on increasing salaries,” he told a mass public rally to mark May Day at the Sokoine Stadium in the southern highlands region of Mbeya. “We have no money to give you. I could have announced a 1 or 2 percent increase right now, but I don’t think that that razor-thin increase will help you,” he said. “It would just trigger high inflation.” “We are currently spending limited financial resources that we have in implementing these projects,”President Magufuli said in his address broadcast live on state TV, referring to major projects like the Stiegler’s Gorge hydropower station, railway and road upgrades and purchase of new aircraft for the national airline, Air Tanzania Company Limited. “When these projects are complete, they will go a long way into reducing the cost of living of Tanzanians, including public servants,” said Magufuli, who was flanked by Vice-President Samia Hassan Suluhu and Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa. The president promised to raise salaries for public servants before the end of his tenure. President Magufuli was elected in 2015. His current term expires in October 2020 when new elections will be held, and if re-elected, he will serve until 2025.
