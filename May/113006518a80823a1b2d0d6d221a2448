ZIFA president Felton Kamambo and PSL chairman Farai Jere on Thursday toured Trojan to check on the progress of refurbishments being done at the stadium. The duo, who have formed a very strong alliance, were satisfied with the work that has been done at the facility. Trojan, which new boys Mushowani want to use as their home base, was one of the four facilities which the ZIFA First Instance Board declared unfit to host top-flight action. Ascot in Gweru, Sakubva in Mutare and Rusape’s Vengere were the other facilities which were deemed unsuitable for the Premiership. Vengere has since been cleared with Manica Diamonds set to use the stadium for the first time in their next home game, next week. “Our main thrust as leaders of the game in the country has always been to push the much-loved sport to all corners of the country,’’ said Jere. “It concerns us, as the leadership, to see top-flight teams travel hundreds of kilometres to play home matches. This season, about four teams have been forced to play their home games away from home due to poor facilities. “It’s not good advertisement for our sport. We need to decentralise the game. Mushowani are supposed to take Premiership action to Bindura but due to lack of proper facilities, they are forced to shift base and, unfortunately, that comes with a lot of costs. Mushowani are owned by an individual and one can imagine the implications. “We are not saying we should compromise standards but if a facility attains a reasonable level then matches should be staged there for the good of the game.”
Kamambo echoed Jere’s sentiments.
