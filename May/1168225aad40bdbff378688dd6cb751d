ZANU-PF has warned MDC leader Nelson Chamisa against making inflammatory remarks and provoking peace loving Zimbabweans. Speaking at a Press conference yesterday, Zanu-PF secretary for Information and Publicity Cde Simon Khaya Moyo said the revolutionary party will never be deterred by any form of threats from MDC leader Chamisa. “Zanu-PF wishes to reiterate to the generality of the population that it will never be deterred by such flimsy acts of cowardice and threats of banditry as it will steadfastly remain resolute on the pronounced economic agenda which intends to spur the nation to an upper middle income economy by the year 2030. “Instead of continuing to hallucinate in the wilderness, Chamisa should rather join hands with progressive forces with a bid to transforming the nation’s economic endeavours,” said Ambassador Khaya Moyo. Zanu-PF, Ambassador Khaya Moyo said will remain grateful to the generality of Zimbabweans for their calmness and adherence to peace in the face of such provocation. “Those quarters who wish doom and agony to this great nation will never succeed,” he said. “The ruling revolutionary party, Zanu-PF notes with utmost contempt and certainly grave concern, the Saturday May 25, 2019 irrational and unstrained outburst by MDC-Alliance leader Chamisa, on the occasion of his party’s congress at Ascot Stadium where he declared his intentions to unleash war to the nation soon after the so called congress. “Having such disgusting sentiments pronounced on Africa Day is not only retrogressive, but irresponsible. Such a statement is an indictment of what Nelson Chamisa and his rogue elements represented”. He said that the declaration by Chamisa that, “As soon as MDC-Alliance congress ends, it will be war,” naturally exhibits the MDC party’s retrogressive nature.
