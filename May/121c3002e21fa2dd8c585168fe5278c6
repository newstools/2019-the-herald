The Herald AMSTERDAM. — Mauricio Pochettino wept tears of joy as the emotional Tottenham manager hailed “super-hero” Lucas Moura for the incredible hat-trick that fired Tottenham into their first Champions League football final. Tottenham enjoyed arguably the greatest night in their history as Lucas’ second-half treble clinched a 3-2 semi-final second-leg win that sent Pochettino’s side through on away goals. With just seconds left at the Johan Cruyff Arena, Tottenham were heading out of the tournament, but Brazilian forward Lucas came to the rescue with a superb strike from the edge of the area. It was all too much for Pochettino, who danced with delight before burying his head in the turf as he let his emotions run wild.— AFP.
