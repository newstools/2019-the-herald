The Herald NEWCASTLE. — Jurgen Klopp said Liverpool have “qualified for our final” after his side scored a late winner at Newcastle to ensure the English Premier League football title race goes to the last day of the season. Divock Origi headed in Xherdan Shaqiri’s free-kick in the 86th minute to send Klopp’s side top, two points above title rivals Manchester City on Saturday. City face Leicester tonight in their penultimate league fixture. “This was a victory of passion, heart and absolute desire,” said Klopp. “It’s destiny. If we’ll be champions we’ll be champions but these boys deliver and deliver and deliver. How can you feel pressure when you do your best? So far 94 points? Come on. It’s incredible.” Klopp believes his side can do no more to end a 29-year wait to win the English Premier League title as Origi’s late winner earned a thrilling 3-2 victory at Newcastle on Saturday despite losing Mohamed Salah to a head knock. Salah was stretchered off 20 minutes from time making him a doubt for tomorrow’s Champions League semi-final, second leg against Barcelona, while Klopp confirmed Roberto Firmino will definitely miss the visit of the Spanish champions to Anfield. “We’ll have to see. He (Salah) took a blow to the head. He watched the game in the locker room, he was OK, but we have to do more tests,” Klopp told Sky Sports. Overturning a 3-0 first leg deficit against Barca now looks an even more monumental task, although Liverpool stay in the hunt for the Premier League title. However, rivals Manchester City have two games remaining to Liverpool’s one. In a recurring theme of a thrilling title race, Liverpool dug deep late on to continue asking questions of the champions by moving two points ahead of City once more. “I accepted long ago we do everything (we can),” said Klopp, whose side have lost only once in the league this season. — AFP.
