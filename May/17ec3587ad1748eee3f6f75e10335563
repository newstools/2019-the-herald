FIVE Kenyans are among athletes who have registered for this year’s JM Busha 54 Races half-marathon at Alex Sports Club this morning. The third edition of the event, under the theme “Peace Pledge,” has attracted local, as well as foreign athletes.
Yesterday, a number of schools and individuals were still registering. JM Busha 54 Races co-ordinator, Pamela Makanjera, said they were expecting five athletes from the East African country, who are coming with their coach. The co-ordinator said should the foreigners win the prize money of $3 000 for the main event, the 21km, they will convert it using the interbank rate and give them the money in foreign currency. “We are trying to build an international race, by having small races in many countries so that in future foreign athletes will come for the big races. “We have five Kenyans and their coach who are coming and they are traveling by bus.
“They have their sponsors, who are catering for this trip.’’
The races include a 21km, 10 km, 5.6 km and 1.6km fun race. “We are trying to identify young, long-distance runners at a young age and we are giving up cash prizes from number 1 up to 20. “We have registered quite a number professional athletes and a sizeable number of school children.
“We have been encouraging schools to register and the school which has a highest number of participants will win a prize. “So far, Mother Touch has registered the highest number of runners.’’
Harare Athletics Board chairman Sebastian Garikai said they were still doing their final verification of the route.
