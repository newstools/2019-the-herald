THE ZIFA leadership has set the game on a developmental trajectory after agreeing to reintroduce, under its wing, the junior leagues. At the conclusion of their annual meeting in Harare at the weekend, ZIFA president Felton Kamambo said congress had agreed to set up junior leagues. “Congress has agreed that we set junior leagues in the country so that we start developing the game from the grassroots and we expect that to be done this year, maybe by September,’’ said Kamambo. “We have not yet agreed on the exact format but we will look, maybe, at having leagues in provinces but that has not yet been agreed. “We are going to launch our online database, which we will call ‘myzifa,’ in order to curb age cheating.’’ In the past, players would be initiated to the football world at tender ages when they curtain-raised Premier League games. Kamambo is passionate about the development of junior football structures.
