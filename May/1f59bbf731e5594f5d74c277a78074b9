The Herald LONDON. – Luis Suarez insists he will show no mercy if he gets the chance to dump former club Liverpool out of the Champions League football. But he believes that whatever fate awaits the Reds against his Barcelona, the glory days are definitely returning to Anfield. Suarez (31) spent four years on Merseyside and admits the club will always have a place reserved in his heart. But ahead of their Champions League semi-final first leg showdown at the Nou Camp at 9pm today, Suarez said if he gets the chance to pile on the misery he will not hesitate. “Liverpool will always be important for me — for giving me an opportunity, for playing a big part in my development, and of course for the amazing fans,” Suarez said. “But this is a Champions League semi-final and all that will matter is helping Barcelona fight to get one step closer to another trophy.” The Uruguay international played four seasons at Anfield between 2010-14 wearing the fabled No. 7 shirt, scoring 69 goals in 110 appearances before leaving for Catalonia. In his final season in a red jersey, Suarez came agonisingly close to landing the English Premier League title in his final season under Brendan Rodgers, losing out to Manchester City. In the penultimate game the sight of the striker sobbing under his shirt as Crystal Palace’s stunning comeback from 3-0 down shattered Liverpool’s hopes become one of the most memorable images of the campaign. – The Daily Express.
