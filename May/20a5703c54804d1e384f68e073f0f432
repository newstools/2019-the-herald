The Herald MOGADISHU. — The African Union’s top envoy in Somalia yesterday hailed pan African union’s troops for their efforts in stabilising the Horn of Africa nation. Francisco Madeira, special representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission for Somalia, said the military, police and civilian components have made significant contribution in degrading the capacity of al-Shabab in Somalia and brought relative peace and stability to the country. “This has yielded significant peace dividends including allowing for the state-building process to thrive and elections to take place in Somalia,” Madeira said in a statement issued to mark the International Labour Day. Madeira, who is the head of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), said efforts of the AU personnel are contributing to the consolidation of the ongoing peace building efforts, humanitarian, stabilisation and early recovery activities. “As we celebrate this year’s Workers’ Day, I urge AMISOM personnel to continue to play their part in ensuring a successful implementation of the ‘Somalia Transition Plan’ (STP),” said the AU envoy. “In the course of discharging our duties in Somalia, many young Africans have paid the ultimate price. The African Union, the people and the government of Somalia are forever obliged to these African heroes and heroines,” he added. Madeira paid tribute to the leadership of the troop and police contributing countries for their unwavering pan-Africanism and resolve to ensure that their security officers continue to work tirelessly with their Somali counterparts to further degrade al-Shabab and other violent groups in Somalia. He hailed the Somali workers for their resolve to continue to strive for the social and economic development of their country despite al-Shabab violence and atrocities. — Xinhua
