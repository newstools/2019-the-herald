The Herald WASHINGTON. — Tiger Woods, fresh off his epic comeback victory in the Masters golf tournament, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday. Presenting the golfing great with the nation’s highest honour, Trump praised Woods’ “relentless will to win, win, win.” “These qualities embody the American spirit of pushing boundaries, defying limits and always striving for greatness,” the president said. Trump congratulated Woods on “your amazing comeback and your amazing life and for giving sports fans a lifetime of memories. “We can’t wait to see what’s next, Tiger,” said Trump, an avid golfer and owner of several golf courses around the world. Woods (43) choked up as he thanked his mother, his two children, his girlfriend and his caddy during the ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. “You have seen the good and the bad, the highs and the lows,” said Woods, who battled back from injury to win the Masters last month, his first major title since the 2008 US Open. “My dad is no longer here, but my mom is here,” Woods said. “I love you, Mom.” — AFP.
