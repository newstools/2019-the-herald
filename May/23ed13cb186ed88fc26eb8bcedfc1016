In a bid to cater for various arts tastes, the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) will incorporate various arts genres at this year’s Culture Week. Dance, music and fashion are among genres that will be on display to entertain and educate people that are expected to attend various events lined up to celebrate the week across the country. Organisers for the event have also released the line-up of musicians who are set to serenade fans during the week-long fiesta, which will run under the theme, “African Royalty – Our Heritage”. The line-up includes Alick Macheso, Enzo Ishall, Baba Harare, Stunner and Janet Manyowa. Some traditional dance groups to take part include Zvido Zvevanhu Traditional Dance Group and Ngoma Dzepasi Traditional Dance Group. National Arts Council acting communications and marketing manager Cathrine Mthombeni said the festival is free for all arts loving people. “The event is free of charge and open to all to attend. This year the culture week activities will revolve around the diverse traditional dances and other art forms (both performing and non performing art forms) depicting important cultural ceremonies. “We also have food festivals, exhibition of cultural artefacts and involvement of other agencies which complement the sector, schools, youth organisations, hotels, arts associations and churches,” she  said. Mthombeni said that the week-long program enables Zimbabwe to reflect on her diversified culture while reminding Zimbabweans of the need to safeguard cultural  practices. “The Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation and National Arts Council of Zimbabwe is encouraging communities at whatever level to come together, celebrate and enjoy their respective cultures in  harmony. “An official launch that heralds the commencement of Culture Week will be launched by His Excellency the President Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa on Saturday at Glamis Arena in Harare,” she  said.
