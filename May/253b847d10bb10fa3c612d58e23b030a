Social media has been awash with images of expensive and luxurious rides. From a Bugatti Veyron Fbg Hemes edition, Bentley Mulsanne, Lamborghini, to a Rolls Royce Ghost, all spotted in different parts of Harare.
Is the famous United States rapper Ricky Ross in town, or is socialite Kylie Jenner of the Kardashian family, shopping at Sam Levy Village?
No! So who owns these cars that have the city not only talking about but whose images are splashed on many people’s WhatsApp statuses. It’s now normal for one to come across super sport and luxury cars driving around, especially in the northern suburbs.
But, when one is coming from the poor side of town — where it’s the Honda Fit, Toyota Wish, Toyota Vitz and Toyota Fun Cargo among many fuel-saving cars that rule the roost — they can imagine or even query if these rides are in Zimbabwe or rather an ingenious Photoshop to make the city glamorous. A walk around the other side of town, a hangout at their shopping malls, or at the city’s hottest and exclusive entertainment spots offers a sneak peak in the life of the wealthy. It shows a glimpse of a thriving Harare, luxurious cars at the centre.
These are rides that can compete with those owned by top South Africa business mogul Patrice Motsepe.
These are the people in Motsepe’s league in Zimbabwe and the rides they own: Bugatti Veyron Fbg Hemes — $2 000 000 USD (estimated value): This masterpiece, one of the most powerful and exclusive super sports cars, is owned by South African based local businessman Frank Buyanga.

Bentley Continental Gt — $300 000 USD (estimated value): You may remember a court case where a couple who had “sowed a seed” in form of a car to Spirit Embassy Ministries founder Prophet Uebert Angel Mudzanire were claiming it back after God did not bless them as promised.

Luxury is a taste only a few can afford. These super cars are expensive to maintain, they guzzle a lot of fuel.

Life may be hard for many Zimbabweans, but seeing the luxury being flaunted around the capital ensures one that there is hope for every man, especially when these cars are owned by self-made millionaires who rose from the same economy we are enduring.
