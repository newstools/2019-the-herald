TWO Gweru men, who attacked and seriously injured a security guard using machetes during a robbery, were last week sentenced to an effective 7 years in prison each, for attempted murder. Mike Makuvire (30) and Dayford Ndamba (36) were convicted despite having pleaded not guilty to the charge when they appeared before Gweru regional magistrate, Mrs Pathekile Msipa. They were initially jailed for 8 years each before 1 year was suspended from each, on condition of good behaviour. The two were also asked to pay back the complainant $135 he had used for his medication, before June 30, 2019. In passing judgement, Mrs Msipa said, “You attacked the complainant knowing that he could die due to the injuries. The court cannot allow people to attack others with machetes. “There is need to respect the sanctity of life therefore a custodian sentence will be a lesson to the two of you and other people as well.” It was the State’s case that on December 7 last year, Makuvire and Ndamba and 5 others who are still at large went to plot 7 of Umusungwe road, Harben Park, Gweru where Enias Pasipamire was on guard duty. The two then pounced on Pasipamire and started attacking him with machetes. The court heard that after the two realised that they had seriously injured Pasipamire, they fled and left him in a pool of blood. He later got assistance from colleagues who took him to Gweru Provincial Hospital for medical antention. Mr Pasipamire sustained head and back injuries as a result of the assault. Mr Kelvin Guveya appeared for the state.
