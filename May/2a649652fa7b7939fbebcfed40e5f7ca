A Harare woman was yesterday fined $200 for possessing unregistered medicine worth $940. Nyarai Chikomba (32) appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Francis Mapfumo charged with possession of unregistered medicines  as defined in Section 129 (1) of the Medicines and Allied Substance Control Act (Chapter 15:03). Mr Mapfumo fined Chikomba  $200 or 30 days’ imprisonment and all the medicines were forfeited to the State. The court heard that on May 7, detectives received information that Chikomba was in possession of dangerous drugs. They proceeded to her house, identified themselves and indicated the purpose of the visit before searching it. They recovered 22 bottles of Bron Cleer cough syrup which were hidden in a deep freezer, an additional four in a bed side headboard drawer and another 21 bottles in a grey purse. The detectives seized the medicines and arrested Chikomba. The bottles were produced in the court as exhibits.
