NATIONAL Athletics Association of Zimbabwe president, Tendai Tagara, believes they will have a bigger event when the JM Busha 54 races peace pledge half marathon is held on May 25 in Harare. The race started in 2017 as a 42km marathon before it was adjusted to 54km last year. However, for this year, it has been shifted to 21km, which will be the main race. The prize money remains the same with the winners for both men and women set to get $3 000. The race, sponsored by JM Busha 54 races, will be held at Alex Sports Club Tagara said despite shifting their focus to a 21km half marathon, they were confident they will attract a huge field. “We are also using the event as part of the selection process for the World Half marathon. “Generally, the half marathon has attracted big numbers in all our road races and the competition is high,” said Tagara. Also on offer will be the 10km, 5km and the 1,6km which will focus on young athletes from schools. Registration started in April and will close two days before the event. JM Busha 54 races coordinator, Pamela Makanjera, said they were now focusing more on the development side. “We are trying to achieve peace through sport but at the same time we want also to develop athletes. “What we have also done to make sure athletes come, we have got an approval from the Ministry of Education, so we have sent letters to all the schools in Harare, Chitungwiza and Mashonaland Central inviting schools to come and participate in that spirit of developing sport,” said Makanjera.
