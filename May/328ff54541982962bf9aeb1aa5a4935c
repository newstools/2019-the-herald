The Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) has called on service providers to invest in call centres in order to meet consumers’ right to be heard and get redress. The call was made after numerous complaints from mobile phone users over serious inefficiencies by operators. Potraz is this week on a consumer education and awareness roadshow whirlwind in Mashonaland Central. While consumer questions on the cost of data continue to dominate, consumers have also expressed their disappointment with providers’ lethargy on call centre service. Addressing consumers at a roadshow at Dandamera Growth Point last week, Potraz consumer affairs manager Phibion Chaibva, said consumers have a right to be heard and get their issues resolved. “As consumers, you must know your rights and must always exercise them,” said Mr Chaibva. “The right to be heard is very important and as Potraz, we are there to see to it that you enjoy this right. “As Potraz we are aware of your worry with the poor call centre service you are getting where one can spend more than an hour on the phone waiting for a service. “We call upon service providers to invest in call centres,” he said. Potraz also reiterated to the consumers that service providers haven’t increased data costs but have suspended data  promotions in line with market changes. “Potraz rejected service providers’ request to increase out of bundle tarrifs,” said Mr Chaibva. “What we have noted is most consumers do not know if they are browsing inbundle or out of bundle hence there is need to have access to operators so they get help and charges are explained adequately,” he said. Postal, Telecommunications and ICTs now plays an integral part in people’s lives and business and access is key to economic revival. Consumers who attended the roadshows thanked the postal and telecommunications regulator for the awareness programme.
