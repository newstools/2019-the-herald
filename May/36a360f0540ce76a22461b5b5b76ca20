ZIFA president Felton Kamambo has promised the Warriors huge incentives, including residential stands, if they progress beyond the group stages at the 2019 AFCON finals. Kamambo, who came into power in December, said plans were at an advanced stage to get residential stands for the Warriors if they do well in Egypt. “Firstly our payment to the players will depend on the stage they would have reached at the AFCON finals,’’ he said. “We have incorporated everyone into this initiative. We need to reward the players and motivate them as far as we can. “We have put in place a fund-raising committee which will be announced soon. The names of those recommended for the fund-raising committee are high-profile and we are sure they will yield the much-anticipated results. “I can also confirm that we have put in place an arrangement whereby we will have to engage the Ministry of Local Government to avail stands to us which we will offer the players if they can go beyond the group stages. “The fund-raising committee is high-profile and we are sure we won’t get it wrong.” The ZIFA boss said contracts will be signed with the players. “The secretariat has done some recommendations which will see the Zimbabwe Football Association signing commitment agreements with the players. “The players will be given what they would have been promised by the association. There will be incentives both at COSAFA and AFCON,” Kamambo said. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe National Soccer Supporters Association and the Friends of the Warriors have endorsed the players selected by coach Sunday “Mhofu” Chidzambwa.
