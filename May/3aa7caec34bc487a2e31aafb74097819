The Herald NEW DELHI. — South Africa’s fast bowler Kagiso Rabada will return home from the Indian Premier League to avoid aggravating a back problem ahead of the Cricket World Cup, the Delhi Capitals said yesterday. The 23-year-old has been in fine form this season, claiming 25 wickets from 12 matches in the IPL, but sat out Wednesday’s game against Chennai Super Kings.
Delhi said Rabada had been advised to return by Cricket South Africa as a precautionary measure. “It’s hard for me to leave the Delhi Capitals at this stage of the tournament.
“But with the World Cup just a month away, a collective decision has been made for me in this regard,” Rabada said in a statement. — AFP.
