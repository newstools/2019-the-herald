THE third edition of the annual JM Busha 54 Races for Peace and Unity in Africa is expected to be a bigger event with the winners set to walk away with a combined total prize money of $60 500. The event, dubbed “Step Up To Peace,” will be held this weekend and will incorporate sporting disciplines like athletics, golf and cycling at Alex Sports Club, Africa Unity Square and Wingate Park and Golf Club. The winners of both the men’s and women’s races will get the same prize money. The main 21km event winners are set to walk away with $3 000 with the first runners-up getting $1 500 and the bronze winners pocketing $1 000. This year’s edition will see, for the first time, a 21km wheelchair race, with the winner pocketing $500. The 10km open race will also see runners battling for $500 prize money. In the golf category, the winners will share R54 000 while, in cycling, winners will split $3 000. JM Busha board member,Tichawana Nyahuma said their organisation was committed to promoting peace and development in Africa through sports activities. “We encourage individuals, young and old, corporates and institutions to step up to peace building, unity and co-existence. “Sport, without doubt, is a tool that can be used to promote and strengthen social ties, tolerance, peace and development. “We strive to make meaningful contributions to the development of sport, that is why we have invested significantly in these games. “We have also reduced the distance of the main race from 54km to 21km but have added 1,6km for young runners in a bid to encourage the younger generation to participate without jeopardising their careers in the long run,” said Nyahuma. National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe president Tendai Tagara said the event will be used to select athletes to present the country at the World Half Marathon Championships in Gdyinia, Poland, next year.
