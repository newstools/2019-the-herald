NGEZI Platinum Stars are facing a crisis after their players yesterday threatened not to fulfil the game against TelOne at Baobab this afternoon demanding an upward review of their salaries. A source at the Mhondoro-based side told The Herald the players were incensed that team’s management were not taking their welfare seriously. The players raised their complaints earlier this year and there was an impasse when the captains, and the club president, met in Harare during the week over the issue. A senior player said the players have resolved to down tools until the club provide guarantees their welfare will be taken care of.
“The president met with our captains to review our salaries’ issue. We want our winning bonuses and our signing-on fees. “We were told to wait for two more weeks and we felt that we cannot continue like this. We told them about this issue back in February.
“We deserve better,” he said. Ngezi Platinum Stars have made a slow start to the season after winning only two of their opening five games, losing two and drawing once.
“Things are not looking good, it’s not as rosy as you see from the outside. “As players we are not prioritised as we should be. The highest player is being paid $900 bond, the rest are below that.
“We want them to improve our living standards only,” said another senior player.
A number of high-profile players left the club at the end of last season.
