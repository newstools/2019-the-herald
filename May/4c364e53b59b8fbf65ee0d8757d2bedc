The Herald LONDON. — Chris Hughton has been sacked by Brighton after four-and-a-half years as the English Premiership football club’s manager. The 60-year-old led the Seagulls to English Premier League survival this season, but they stayed up by just two points after winning only 11 points in 18 games in 2019. Hughton’s assistant Paul Trollope and first-team coach Paul Nevin have also left the club. Brighton chairman Tony Bloom said: “Chris has done an excellent job, first stabilising our club — reaching the play-offs in his first full season — securing our first ever promotion to the Premier League, and retaining our status in two successive seasons. “Undoubtedly this has been one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make as chairman of Brighton, but ultimately one I have made due to how we struggled in the second half of the season. Our run of three wins from 23 Premier League matches put our status at significant risk. It is with that in mind, and the performances during that period, that I now feel it’s the right time for a change.” — Sky Sports.
