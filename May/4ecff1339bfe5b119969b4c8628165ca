ZIMBABWE athletics coach, David Tinago, is confident his charges will clock an improved time when they race at the World Relay team in Yokohama, Japan, next week. The relay team leaves tomorrow for Yokohama. The quartet of Ngoni Makusha, Tatenda Tsumba, Dickson Kamungeremu and Itayi Vambe will represent the country, which is participating for the first time, at the relay Championships. Fifth athlete, Dickson Kapandura, is also part of the delegation. The relay team broke the national record of 39.16 seconds, which had stood for 12 years, by posting a credible time of 38.95 seconds. But the coach, who has been working hard with the boys on the track and at the gym, says the athletes have improved since the Botswana meet at the Lefika Athletics Club Relays and Hurdles Event. “The boys will better the Gaborone time (38.95seconds) based on the preparations we had”, the coach said. “There are also a few tips that we have given them. “I am really confident of them actually running even a faster time than the one they posted.’’ The athletics team received a timely boost last week when the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee partnered with the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe to secure airfares for the team. ZOC are hopeful the athletes could have a chance to qualify for Tokyo Olympics. And Tinago, a former athlete who prides in himself holding the Southern Region record for 400m in 2005, says the sprinters were all motivated. “Our preparations have gone on very well,’’ he said”. This is really a good opportunity for the boys. “They are fully motivated right now to go to participate at the World Relay.’’ Makusha has participated at a number of international meets.
