President Mnangagwa is expected to commission a state-of-the-art Labour Court next week on Monday when the second legal term begins. The Judicial Service Commission is finalising  preparations to ensure that everything is in place ahead of the commissioning of the new courthouse by President Mnangagwa. JSC acting secretary Mr Walter Chikwana yesterday confirmed that the new court opens to the public next week. He said preparations for the official opening of the courthouse were progressing well. “The new courthouse is going to be commissioned by President Mnangagwa,” he said. “Thereafter the operations of the Labour Court will be based at the new building.” Mr Chikwana said judges of the Labour Court are yet to move to their new place since they are still on vacation and are expected to join the rest of the staff already there for the beginning of the second legal term on the commissioning date. “They (judges) will formally move to their chambers at the new building on the opening day of the courthouse,” he said. The three-storey structure is situated along Rotten Row overlooking the magistrates’ courts. Chief Justice Luke Malaba toured the building in March and expressed satisfaction with the renovations that were done on the imposing structure. He commended the JSC for pitching high standards for the country’s courts. “This is beautiful and no one can refuse to work here,” he said. “I am impressed and we should organise a befitting opening ceremony for the building.” The grand structure has enough space for all stakeholders including the police, sheriff and information technology. Judges of the Labour Court will now have bigger and spacious offices. The expansive building also accommodates support staff and other important stakeholders like the sheriff and the police. The Labour Court was operating from Bristols Building along Kwame Nkrumah Avenue in Harare, which was too small for the court’s operations.
