A Harare man lost a bag containing US$4 100 and R53 000 to four thieves at Mbare Musika after they misled him into believing that his vehicle had a dent before snatching the bag on Saturday. The incident occurred at around 4pm and police have since arrested two of the suspects, but have not recovered the money. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident. “The two accused persons, who were part of a gang of four, approached a 32-year-old man who was seated in his vehicle and lied that his car had a dent at the back. “The complainant went to check and the accused person stole a bag that contained ZAR53 000 and US$4 100 that was in the vehicle,” he said. He said the two suspects were arrested after they were captured by a CCTV camera installed at a nearby tuckshop. “Nothing was recovered as the money was taken by the other two accomplices who are still at large,” Asst Comm Nyathi said. He urged members of the public to avoid carrying large sums of money as they risked losing it to criminals. Meanwhile, police in Manicaland have arrested two suspects on allegations of smuggling an excavator and a tractor into the country from Mozambique through an illegal crossing point in Katiyo area. Police arrested the two suspects after a tip-off and recovered a Massey Ferguson tractor, a trailer, bowser and the excavator parked at an estate in the area. “Members of the public are urged to refrain from engaging in nefarious activities such as smuggling as this impacts negatively on the economic development of the country,” he said.
