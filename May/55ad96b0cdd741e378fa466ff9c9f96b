Chirikure Chirikure’s Shona poem will be one of several works on display in libraries and parks in London from June 7.
A total of 100 poems in 45 languages will be displayed in eight public spaces in the Waltham Forest area to symbolise the beauty and value of languages spoken in London. The initiative is organised by the Waltham Forest Bilingual Group in conjunction with a poetry organisation.
Chirikure’s poem, “Inongova ‘Yes Yes’”, was selected to be part of the project. The poem was first published in Chirikure’s collection of poems, “Rukuvhute”, in 1989. Chirikure went on to record the poem with mbira music with DeteMbira, on the album “Napukeni” in 2002. The album was engineered and produced by the late music icon, Oliver Mtukudzi. Chirikure still performs the poem solo or with music accompaniment. The poem is available on several platforms, in translated versions.
Chirikure said he is honoured to be part of the project. “It is always an honour to have your works included in positive international initiatives. It is also an honour to profile our languages and culture on global platforms. I hope this opportunity will encourage us not to lose our indigenous languages. Whether you are in Zimbabwe or in the diaspora, it is vital to remain proud of your culture.” The display of poems in different languages of the world is one of the several initiatives by the Waltham Forest Bilingual Group to encourage use of many languages in the United Kingdom communities. The Waltham Forest Bilingual Group is a voluntary group of multilingual parents established in 2003.
Their aim is to promote, foster, encourage and celebrate linguistic and cultural diversity by supporting parents raising their children bilingually.
