The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United are prepared to pay half of Alexis Sanchez’s mammoth £26 million salary to secure him a move this summer. The final decision over the Chilean’s future will be left to manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but United are open to off-loading the forward. United chiefs are aware Sanchez’s £500 000-per-week wage, inclusive of bonuses, will prove a major stumbling block. So, it is understood they are resigned to paying as much as 50 percent of the ex-Arsenal star’s wages to tempt another club to take him.
United’s preference is to sell Sanchez abroad as there is great reluctance to see him join a top-six Premier League rival. Paying £13 million a season for a player not even at the club is hardly an ideal scenario — but United realise slashing £250 000 a week from their wage bill would be a significant boost in terms of packages they can offer prospective signings. United believe the best hope they have of moving Sanchez (30) this summer is on loan. Such a deal would enable them to renegotiate an alternative exit route for Sanchez ahead of the 2020-21 season, particularly if the forward can recapture his best form elsewhere. Sanchez has struggled since moving to Old Trafford, failing to recapture the form that led to United making such a massive financial commitment in 2018. Meanwhile, Paul Pogba may have to take a pay cut from his £290 000-a-week wage at Manchester United if he joins Real Madrid. The Spanish side have been tracking the Frenchman and Zinedine Zidane has repeatedly spoken in glowing terms about the 26-year-old. But a possible stumbling block this summer could be the financial side of the deal, according to Marca.
Pogba earns £15 million a year at Old Trafford and is one of the best paid players at the club.
