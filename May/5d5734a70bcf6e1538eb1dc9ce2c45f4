CHAPUNGU coach Rodwell Dhlakama says there is every reason to start dreaming big following a good start to this season’s marathon. The Air Force of Zimbabwe side have exceeded expectations with two wins and a draw in their opening four league games this year. The wins include a 5-0 destruction of Bulawayo Chiefs and a commendable away victory over Triangle United. ‘’We have started the season very well and that is important if we are to create good memories. We just have to maintain this form by keeping the players motivated and allowing them to express themselves,’’ said Dhlakama. “These results are not a fluke and the way we are playing is a sign for better things to come. We just need to keep the focus and there is every reason to start dreaming. “Against Triangle, we actually should have scored more goals, but getting three points was the objective and I am happy we managed to do that.’’ Players at Chapungu have been together for some time now and are turning into an efficient unit. Stars like Ian Nyoni, Blessed Mbavarira and Talbert Shumba are playing well. “We do not have a specific target to say we want to achieve this and that, but we just want to make our supporters very happy. We are different from those teams who buy whoever they like on the market. “Our players are doing very well and you can see that some of them are ripe for international football,” he said.
