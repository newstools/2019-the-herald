The Herald KAMPALA. — The She Cranes, Uganda’s national women’s netball team, proved a superior side in friendly encounters against the Zimbabwe Gems that ended yesterday at Allen VR Stanley Arena in Nakirebe. The sides competed in four games as part of preparations for the Netball World Cup between July 12-21 in Liverpool, England. The opening fixture on Sunday ended in a 57-53 win for the hosts, followed by 57-53 and 58-48 wins on Monday, as well as Tuesday’s 58-54 victory. Poor centre field and defence positions were among the She Cranes weaknesses that resulted into more rebounds and stolen balls. With reliable centre player Halima Nakachwa going AWOL last year during the English Test Series, the team was left with youngster Betty Kizza to inspire them. “We have started feeling that Nakachwa left a big gap,” said coach Nelson Bogere. The She Cranes defence was also found wanting in as far as fitness was concerned. Defenders Joan Nampungu, Lillian Ajio, Hindu Namutebi and Irene Akello did not disappoint but appeared to tire. “These games have been competitive and they have exposed our weak side, I believe our fitness will improve when we go to gym,” said Lilian Ajio the She Cranes vice-captain.
