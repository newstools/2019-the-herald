Police have arrested two more members of shadowy anti-Government organisations who allegedly received training in Maldives with intent to roll out violent demonstrations in the country. They are the Director of Female Prisoners Support Trust Rita Nyampinga and Stabile Dewa, the Director of Womenâ€™s Academy for Leadership and Political Excellence. The two were arrested soon after landing at Robert Gabriel Mugabe (RGM) International Airport on Monday, before being taken to Harare Central Police Station for further investigations. They will appear in court soon. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the arrests yesterday. The arrest of the two brings to seven the number of suspects arrested in connection with the case since last week. Last week, five members of shadowy anti-Government organisations who allegedly received training in Maldives with intent to roll out violent demonstrations in the country, appeared in court facing allegations of subverting a constitutionally-elected Government.
