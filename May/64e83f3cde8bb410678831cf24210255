The Herald Sikhumbuzo Moyo in Bulawayo
TelOne ……………………………………0 Highlanders………………………..(1) 1 RAY Lunga gave Highlanders a ray of hope that all is not lost when he scored in the first half to give a previously winless Bosso their first set of three points at the expense of Castle Lager Premiership football debutants TelOne at Barbourfields yesterday. Sadly he had to be pulled out through injury in the second half following numerous tackles on him by the visitors’ players. “We needed this win, we needed it so badly and I am happy that I scored the goal that helped us break the ice. We march on now and look forward to our next match,” said the pint-sized Lunga, son to club legend Gift Lunga (Snr). Prior to yesterday’s match the Bulawayo giants had not only gone for eight matches without a win but they had even failed to find the target at Barbourfields despite brilliant performances by the players. It was the same scenario yesterday where their play was calculated with coach Madinda Ndlovu having given former Dynamos player Cleopas Kapupurika his first start of the season and the winger was not a disappointment. He gave the TelOne defenders torrid moments every time he was in possession of the ball but he seemed starved of balls in the second stanza. The win brought smiles to Highlanders supporters who celebrated the achievement as if they had won the championship. Highlanders face city neighbours Bulawayo Chiefs in their next match and travel to Yadah for game 11 before playing host to arch-rivals Dynamos in Week 12.
