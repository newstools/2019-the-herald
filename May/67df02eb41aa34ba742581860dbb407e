A 25-year-old illegal diamond miner from Buhera was shot dead in Chiadzwa last Wednesday by a Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) security guard, after he teamed up with other panners to confront the mining company’s guards. Although Manicaland Police spokesperson Taviringwa Kakohwa said he was yet to receive information regarding the incident, sources within the police told The Herald that the deceased, Terrence Masendeke of Jori Village under Chief Nyashanu, had been illegally mining one of ZCDC fields with about 300 others. “On May 15 at around 10am, ZCDC security guard, Dulula Chinamano (54) was in the company of four other security guards namely Zengeni Givemore (52), Cosio Kashambwa (48), Makambwa Clever (46) and Victor Bepete (39) patrolling the perimeters of Chiadzwa diamond fields. “Chinamano was armed with an FN Browning shotgun loaded with four live ammunition at Chikwarukwaru area in Portal A.
‘‘They discovered about 300 illegal panners panning diamonds outside the perimeter fence,” said the source. He said some the panners resisted the guards’ command to stop panning and decided to gang up and confront the guards.
Following the conflict, Chinamano fired three warning shots in the air but the miners kept advancing towards them. Chinamano allegedly then fired one shot at the illegal panners and they fled. The source said the security guards were later alerted by one of the miners that Masendeke had been shot.
His body was discovered lying about 100 metres from the scene and the security guards informed their supervisor, Masimba Ngwenya (38) who subsequently made a report to Chiadzwa police.
