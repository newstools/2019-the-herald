DESPITE several glitches and delays in their trip once scheduled for April 22, Zimbabwe senior netball team captain Perpetua Siyachitema says her charges remain ready to draw lessons from Uganda. The East Africans are ranked higher on the International Netball Federation rankings. The trip was first rescheduled from April 22 to last Thursday before it was further delayed, with the team having to leave for East Africa yesterday afternoon.
Speaking before the send-off ceremony, Siyachitema said her charges remained composed and ready for a showdown against the Ugandans. “Although there had been delays, the Government assured us that all was under control, so we did not panic,’’ said Siyachitema.
“We know this trip is very beneficial to us more than the hosts, so we remained unfazed knowing that whichever hour we would travel, we are looking forward to very important lessons there.’’’
The Gems will be in Uganda for five days. “We have new players in the squad and these international friendlies are meant to help us identify areas that need to be dealt with while giving the new players an international experience,’’ she said.
“At the World Cup, experience will be an advantage, therefore, it is key that we have these friendlies, but let it be known that this is not the final squad that will participate in Liverpool. “This is a time that the netball family should unite for a common cause but, unfortunately, many are purporting to emotionally support, yet they are causing false alarm out there, which is really not healthy at this hour.’’
