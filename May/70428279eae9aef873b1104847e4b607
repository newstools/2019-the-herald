ZIMBABWEAN sprinter Ngoni Makusha says it was heart-breaking to get disqualified from the World Relays after posting a decent time in their qualifying heat in the men’s 4x100m event at the just-ended IAAF World Relay Championships in Yokohama, Japan. The Zimbabwean quartet of Makusha, Tatenda Tsumba, Dickson Kamungeremu and Itayi Vambe posted a good time of 38.98 seconds in Heat Two of the qualifiers on Saturday. But they were later disqualified after the starter (Kamungeremu) was ruled to “have stepped over the line”. But the Zimbabwean relay team, which left Japan yesterday, say they will not let the incident affect their future assignments. “It is heartbreaking, but we are happy that we managed to compete with the world’s best and even though we got a disqualification, our time wasn’t bad as we ran 38.98 seconds which is a good time,” said Makusha. “It’s now back to the drawing board as we still have the Southern Regions and the African Games to look forward to,” Makusha said. The 12th African Games will be held in Morocco from August 19 to 31. National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe director for coaching, talent identification and development, Lisimati Phakamile, also backed the atheletes.
