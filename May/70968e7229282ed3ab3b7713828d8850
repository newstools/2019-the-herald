BORROWDALE Park will explode into life this afternoon with the 57th edition of the 2000m Castle Tankard (GR1) race. Sixteen runners will battle in the race. This edition has a $100 000 purse in stakes with three stables, Penny Fisher, Bridget Stidolph and Kirk Swanson, who have previous winners in the Tankard before, bringing on some of their best runners. Bookmakers are seeing Simona, Heir Line, Amsterdam, Knuckleball, Peggson and Bush Pilot as some of the favourites. They have form, most are distance suited, and if one of the top weights triumphs, it will restore faith in Merit Ratings. Simona is set to carry 60 kgs, Heir Line 59.5, Amsterdam 59, Knuckleball 58 and Peggson 57.5. Unfortunately, Amsterdam must overcome a wide draw. Initially, Bush Pilot (54kgs) could not be included, here, because his four wins have ranged from 1200 – 1700m. Twilight Trip will carry 59 kgs and his winning range is from 1200 – 1600m. Fareeq (AUS) (56.5) a six-year-old gelding by Nadeem (AUS) has raced twice at Borrowdale over 1200m and 1600m and his five wins in KZN and Gauteng were over 1400m and 1600m.
