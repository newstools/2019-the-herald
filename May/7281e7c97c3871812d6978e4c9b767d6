The Herald LONDON. — Eden Hazard will be officially unveiled as a Real Madrid player after Chelsea play their Europa League football final against Arsenal on May 29, according to reports in France. Real have been linked with a move for Hazard all season, and are said to have all but finalised a €100million (£86m) deal for the forward. Hazard has fuelled speculation suggesting he would link up with Real manager Zinedine Zidane at the Bernabeu all season by refusing commit his future to Chelsea. Now L’Equipe report that an agreement for the 28-year-old was done weeks ago, but will only be made public once the Blues’ season officially ends. That will come in Baku on May 29, when Chelsea face Arsenal in an all-London encounter and one of two all-Premier League European finals this season. Hazard has been the brightest spark in an uneven season for Chelsea, where fans have often expressed displeasure at manager Maurizio Sarri’s selections and football style. Despite this, Chelsea finished third in the Premier League to qualify for the Champions League, and have reached two major cup finals. Meanwhile, Zinedine Zidane admits he sent Gareth Bale a message after excluding him from the Real Madrid for a second successive weekend. “I do not know, we’ll see if he’ll be here next week, he’s fine physically”, he said when asked about Bale’s absence from the 3-1 defeat by Real Sociedad on Sunday. “It’s very clear what I’ve done this weekend, we’ll see what I do next week and what happens next year,” he added. — — Mailonline.
