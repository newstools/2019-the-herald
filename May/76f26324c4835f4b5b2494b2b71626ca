Three men from Epworth and Chitungwiza, who were last week arrested for stealing a beast, have been sentenced to 10 years in prison each, by a Goromonzi Magistrate’s Court. Farai Mupopa (45) and Nelson Chizuzu (37), both of Epworth and Pheneas Mushangwe (36) of Chitungwiza were imprisoned following their arrest at a roadblock along Goromonzi Road. They was caught with six 50kgs bags of stacked meat in their car and after thorough investigations, police discovered that they had stolen a beast from Lawrence Murape (46) of Murape Village under chief Chikwaka. Mashonaland East police spokesperson Inspector Tendai Mwanza confirmed the arrest and appealed to the public to embrace operational roadblocks as they are effective in curbing crime. “Police roadblocks are proving to be one of the most effective strategies to curb crime. It is therefore our appeal to members of the public to view our operational roadblocks in good light as we forge partnerships to eradicate various nefarious activities within our societies.” On May 14 at around 2am, police were manning a security roadblock at Majuru Business centre when they stopped a motor vehicle. After stopping the vehicle they carried out a search. After searching the car, police discovered six 50kg bags full of stacked meat. Upon requesting to know the origins of the meat, the suspects indicated that they had brought the meat from their rural home in Murewa. Police became suspicious and apprehended the suspects before taking them to Goromonzi police station for further investigations. Through indications, the suspects led the police to Murape village under Chief Chikwaka where they had stolen one cow from Lawrence Murape’s pen during the night. The convicts drove the beast from the pen for about 300 metres before slaughtering it in the bush. They packed the meat in 50kg bags and decided to take the meat to Epworth.
