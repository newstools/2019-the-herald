A New crop of talented dancehall artistes has arisen in the upper part of Mashonaland West Province. Some coming from as far as Mola in rural Nyaminyami District, the talented and committed lot is pioneering a movement that is set to take the country by storm. Most of the musicians sing in Tonga, which has made their dancehall a new flair on the local scene. Nyaminyami FM in Kariba is leading the lyrical and riddim insurgency which is set to pervade the country genre and nourish music appetites. To that end a clash of 15 of the previously unheralded artist is slated for this Friday on the station to herald the beginning of a movement whose impact is set to break the station’s conventional geographical reach. However, those not on the traditional radio can follow the station on various platforms including Facebook or stream live on the internet. Jah Razor Fire is rocking with hit song Chilila Nduwe (Cry unto you God) which is a cry to God for divine intervention in life’s challenges. Another gem Mudza Tee is making waves with Ndiyanda Kakwata while Blackers has set the airwaves on fire with the song Luyando. Flexman is also rocking with Ndilimwana Muchalila while T-Flow, Sibla, Squed Vybz, Nodza Tee and Judge of the Jars are also contributing to the growing influence of the Tonga-themed music. Tacicias Phiri, known on air as DJ Mamonya Matete, who is hosting the clash this Friday said the move was aimed at promoting the artists and reward them for their effort to showcase their talent. “These are artists who are coming from the remotest parts of Nyaminyami district in areas like Mola and Siakobvu who are defying all odds to express themselves beautifully and entertain the nation.
