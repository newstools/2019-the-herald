Twenty-year-old Mitchelle Mupasi from Gweru was recently crowned queen of Miss Tourism Midlands 2019 after shrugging off competition from 14 other contestants at provincial finals held at King Solomon Hotel in Kwekwe. She automatically won her ticket to represent her province at the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe pageant to be held on a date to be announced. The first princess crown went to Maria Makelve (21), while Zwoluga Moyo was voted second princess. The beauty queen, who is studying for a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Health at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST), said it has always been her dream to be a model. “I am truly moved with the pageant results because the competition was really tough, as l had to battle it out with strong and beautiful girls. As the newly crowned queen I believe that there is so much work ahead of me. “With the help of Ms Mavis Koslek modelling agency, I have begun my grooming and deportment lessons for the finals. I hope to bring the crown home,” she said. Asked her next step after being crowned the queen, Mupasi said she was going to sit down with her two princesses and embark on projects that can help develop and sustain her community apart from empowering the girl child. The pageant was hosted by Gweru based modelling guru Mavis Koslek, who is the Midlands license holder for the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe pageant and founder of Image Modelling Agency. In an interview modelling expert Koslek said this year’s pageant attracted 15 models. “I am happy that the show went on well, and thank God that the pageant was a peaceful one. We had beautiful girls from all over the country. ‘‘‘We had no cash to give as sponsorship was limited. We operated on a constrained budget,” said Koslek. The event was held under the theme “Zimbabwe at work through tourism and beauty”.
