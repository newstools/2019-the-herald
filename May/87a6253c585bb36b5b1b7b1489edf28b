Police in Apel near Lebowakgomo outside Polokwane have launched a massive manhunt for a group of armed suspects, among them a Zimbabwean man, in connection with a case of robbery at guest houses in the Mohlaletse area. Limpopo police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe identified the Zimbabwean as Bothwell Mlagisi. “It is alleged that a group of suspects attacked the employees at this overnight accommodation, shot one of them and ransacked the building,” he said. “The suspects thereafter uninstalled the plasma TVs on the walls, loaded them inside their vehicle and stole several other electrical appliances before they fled the scene in a white BMW sedan. “The police were summoned and reacted swiftly. They immediately went after the suspect’s car until its driver lost control, veered off the road and rammed into a tree. The suspects then fled on foot. “Our officers searched the car and recovered more than 10 plasma TVs, cellphones, TV remote controls, laptops, CCTVs, clothing, etc.” Col Ngoepe said the vehicle used by the suspects belonged to one of the national soccer team players. He said the player has not been arrested but was assisting police with investigations. “Preliminary investigations revealed that he was not in the car during this incident but he is cooperating with the police to track down the suspects, one of whom has already been identified. “The suspects involved in this matter, including the driver of this motor vehicle, is still on the run. ‘‘The police are calling upon Bothwell Maligasi, who is a Zimbabwean national, to come to Apel Police Station or the nearest police station to assist with investigations in this matter,” said Col Ngoepe. He said anyone with information that can lead to the apprehension of the suspects should contact Colonel Moyahabo Morudi at +2782 565 7646 or the crime stop number +27860010111 or the crime line SMS 32211 or the nearest Police Station.
