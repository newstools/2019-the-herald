The Herald LIVERPOOL. — Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde admitted his team had only themselves to blame for their “terrible” Champions League semi-final collapse at Liverpool on Tuesday. Barca were blown away on an incredible night at Anfield as Liverpool won 4-0 to overturn a three-goal first-leg defeat. “Things got on top of us after those two quick goals. We didn’t manage to get on the scoresheet and they rolled us over really,” he said. “It’s a terrible result for our fans and for ourselves. It’s really, really unfortunate, but credit to Liverpool. “We tried to sit a little bit deeper, but the tie ended for us with the fourth goal. We couldn’t respond.” It was a second successive Champions League humiliation for Barca after they squandered a 4-1 first-leg lead in the quarter-finals last season, going out on away goals to Roma after losing the return 3-0. “I do not know how it’s going to affect me, here we are, the coach has to take responsibility,” he said. “It’s very painful for us, especially for our people, it’s the second year they’ve come back like that.” The Catalan club haven’t won the Champions League since 2015. Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets was quick to say sorry for one of the most chastening results in their history. “I apologise to the fans because after the Rome thing, it happens again, it is very hard to fall like that with a good result in the first leg,” Busquets said. — AFP.
