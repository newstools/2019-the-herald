A teenage girl is lucky to be alive after her stomach was ripped open after she was stabbed by her neighbour for turning down his love proposal. The teen was stabbed by Blessing Masukume (21) of London Farm in Gweru, who appeared before Gweru regional magistrate Mrs Phathekile Msipa facing one count of attempted murder. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was remanded in custody. For the State, Mr Kelvin Guvheya, told the court that on the fateful day, Masukume went to the girl’s home to collect his memory card. The court heard that Masukume proposed love to the girl, promising to give her the memory card for good. “She tried giving back Masukume his memory card, but he refused, saying she can keep it and in turn, he wanted her to accept his love proposal to her,” said Mr Guvheya. He told the court that Masukume was incensed when the girl rejected his proposal. “The complainant turned down the proposal and this did not go down well with Masukume who produced an okapi knife from his pocket and tried to stab her,” said Mr Guvheya. “The complainant then fled to her mother’s bedroom with Masukume in hot pursuit. “He stabbed her twice on the stomach, leaving her intestines protruding, before fleeing from the scene.” The court heard that the teen screamed for help, attracting the attention of neighbours. “She was ferried to Maboleni Clinic where she was further transferred to Gweru Provincial Hospital where she was treated,” said Mr Guvheya. The matter was reported to Maboleni Police Station and Masukume was arrested in March after being on the run for three months.
