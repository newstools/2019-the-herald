PROMISING Zimbabwean sprinter Panashe Majuru is scheduled to leave the country this week to compete in five high-profile track and field meetings in The Netherlands and Belgium this month and in June. Majuru (20), a 400m specialist and a 110m hurdler, is one of three Zimbabwean athletes who were invited by Peter Wolters, the director and head coach of the Dutch-based Milers Foundation, to compete in the European circuit. The others are Ngoni Makusha and Tatenda Tsumba who were part of the Zimbabwe men’s 4x100m relay team which recently competed at this year’s IAAF World Relay Championships in Yokohama, Japan, where they were disqualified in the qualifying heats. Former Zimbabwean top sprinter and Olympian Lloyd Zvasiya engineered the move for these three athletes to go and compete in five track and field meetings in The Netherlands and Belgium, starting this coming Saturday. And Zvasiya told The Herald yesterday that Majuru, a former Prince Edward School pupil, has now acquired his visa which would allow him to travel to Europe anytime this week. “Everything has now been sorted out for Panashe Majuru. He now has his (Schengen) visa and should be leaving for Europe in a day or two this week after he has collected his air ticket but as for the other two, Ngoni Makusha and Tatenda Tsumba, I don’t think they are interested in going there.
