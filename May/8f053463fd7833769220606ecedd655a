NATIONAL Association of Secondary School Heads acting president, Arthur Maphosa, says they are eager to continue playing a pivotal role in the development of football in the country. Pamushana High will host this year’s Copa Coca-Cola football tournament launch today. Pamushana are the boys’ defending champions while Nyamauru, from Manicaland, are the title holders in the girls section after upstaging Chidyamakono last year. This year marks the 31st edition of the football competition that has become key in the development of the game across the country over the years. Some of the players who have used this tournament to showcase their talents include Harare City’s Tatenda Tumba. “It’s our 31st edition this year, we are at Pamushana High, winners from last year in the boys’ section and what we can say is we are looking forward to a successful event tomorrow (today),’’ he said. “You will note that this one has actually become the oldest soccer tournament in the country.’’ Today’s launch will be followed by the zonal games on May 24 and the district competition is slated for June 7. The provincial finals are scheduled for June 28, culminating into the national finals to run from July 11 to 13 in Mashonaland West. “We are inviting as many of the Premier Soccer League and Division One teams to attend our tournament, so that they can scout for the best talent in the country,’’ he said. “We are inviting them. “We will also be happy if our own soccer legends come to the tournament so that they inspire our young footballers. “Last year, I remember, we had the likes of Justice Majabvi, who was part of us in Zvishavane. “And even the legend Desmond Maringwa, who was there in the Midlands. This was an inspiration to the youngsters to try and take the game to another higher level.’’
