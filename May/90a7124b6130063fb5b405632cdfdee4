ONE of Zimbabwe’s top junior motocross riders, Emile Croisette, will have his first taste of racing in a major international event when he takes part in Canada’s most prestigious race meeting in August. She will compete in the TransCan Walton Grand National Championships. It is a week-long festival of fun and excitement.
For this annual “Celebration of Canadian Motocross,” over 1 000 motocross riders and their families from around the world make their way to Canada to compete. This year’s TransCan Grand National Championship is set to run from August 13-17 at Walton Raceway in Walton, Ontario.
And young Zimbabwean rider Croisette (10), currently riding in the 65cc Class, will make his debut appearance at this major international event. Croisette left for Canada on Tuesday where he will first attend a five-week training camp at MotoPark under one of Canada’s top motocross trainers Zeb Dennis ahead of the Transcan Grand National Championship. He left for Canada after competing in the third round of this year’s South African National Championship series at BORC in Bloemfontein this last Saturday where he finished in the top 10 in the 65cc Class. “Such a great weekend at Bloemfontein. I battled and battled . . . After three rounds0 (of the South African National Championship series) I’m now seating in 12th position (out of 32 riders) in the 65cc Standings. “Today (Tuesday) I’m leaving to train in Canada at MotoPark with Zeb Dennis for 5 weeks to be ready for the Walton Grand National,” Croisette wrote on his Facebook wall on Tuesday. Croisette is among a number of young Zimbabwean motocross riders who have been leaving the country to take part in major international events overseas. In November last year, the country’s top female rider Tanya Muzinda and male biker Regan Wasmuth took part in the annual Thor Winter Olympics Supercross and Motocross Championship in Florida, United States.
