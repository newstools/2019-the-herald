AFTER watching his team being frustrated to a scoreless stalemate at home by Herentals, FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza has mourned negative tactics being employed by other teams. The former Warriors gaffer implored the authorities to come up with a plan of stopping those employing negative tactics to win games. “I knew in the second half it was not going to be easy, you could see that everybody was going down, I think it is a norm now (to employ delaying tactics),’’ said Mapeza. “We were attacking and the ‘keeper just went down, I was surprised, it is not football but if it was something else that is bad again. “If (the opponent) is injured I really understand the situation. “I remember talking about it after our game against Mushowani and I recall someone telling me that was their game plan. “I do not like to comment about other team’s game plans, but I do not think it will take our football further. “But, at the end of the day, it is about the authorities, maybe the referees’ association to discuss on what they can do to solve this problem. “Because it is happening, but I will not encourage my players or my goalkeeper to go down either we are winning 1-0 or 2-0, I will not encourage people to do that, never.’’
