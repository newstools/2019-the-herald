The Herald LONDON. — Christian Eriksen has verbally agreed to a deal to join Spanish football giants Real Madrid in the summer, according to reports. The Tottenham ace’s future in North London has been left in the dark, having decided against signing a new contract. Eriksen’s current deal expires next summer, meaning Spurs will need to cash in now or risk losing him for nothing in 12 months time. According to AS, Real Madrid will need to stump up around £130 million to lure him to the Bernabeu. Half the work is already complete, with Eriksen reportedly agreeing to join Zinedine Zidane’s side at the end of the season. Now they just need to negotiate with the notoriously astute Spurs chairman Daniel Levy to cash in on their key asset. Madrid do have transfer history with Spurs after landing both Luka Modric and Gareth Bale in previous high-profile deals. But this transfer could prove more difficult after Real Madrid angered Levy with their approach for manager Mauricio Pochettino. Los Blancos wanted to hold talks with the Argentine coach following the sacking of Santiago Solari earlier in the campaign before the appointment of Zidane. Eriksen’s form has been instrumental for Tottenham this season, with nine goals and 16 assists across the league and Champions League. But he failed to put his stamp on the contest on Tuesday night as his side crashed to a 1-0 home defeat at Ajax. And it appears Real Madrid fans were far from impressed with his performance, with some even demanding the club look elsewhere in the summer. One wrote: “Eriksen constantly linked with Real Madrid but keeps on doing disasterclasses in the Champions League.” Another added: “You better stay the f * * * away from Eriksen @realmadrid.” —  The Sun.
