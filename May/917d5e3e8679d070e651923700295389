The Herald LONDON. — Virgil van Dijk believes Liverpool are close to rediscovering the fear factor that made the club such a dominant force for nearly two decades as they target European football glory. Between 1973 and 1990, the Reds claimed 11 league titles and a quartet of European Cups, all four won in an eight-season spell. Liverpool, who will face Tottenham in the Champions League final in Madrid on June 1, were the most feared side on the continent and the benchmark for the rest of Europe. The Anfield side fell behind domestic and European rivals, but Tuesday’s remarkable 4-3 aggregate win over Barcelona secured back-to-back Champions League finals and Van Dijk believes they are starting to re-establish their standing in the game. “Hopefully. That’s something we work towards,” said the Dutch captain. “I feel that (Manchester) City already have that bit of status because they have been dominating last year so much.” — AFP.
