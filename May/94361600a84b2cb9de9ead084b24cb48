Police have arrested a foreigner on allegations of attempting to smuggle a Toyota Land Cruiser through Nyamapanda Border Post. In a statement yesterday, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the arrest and said investigations were still in progress. “A foreign national was arrested at Nyamapanda Border Post on 17th May 2019 at around 1740 hours when he tried to bring a Toyota Land Cruiser pick up, registration number AAF378GZ, into the country. “Checks made by members of the Criminal Investigations Department stationed at the border post revealed that the chassis number of the vehicle matched that of a Toyota Land Cruiser pick-up truck registration number BLB708FS which was reported stolen in South Africa. “Meanwhile the vehicle has been impounded as investigations into the matter continue,” he said.
Asst Comm Nyathi said the police will remain alert countrywide to thwart any criminal and smuggling activities.
In January, the Hawks arrested two suspects believed to be part of a racket stealing vehicles from South Africa and smuggling them to other countries via Zimbabwe. It was understood that most of the stolen cars find their way to Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania.
One of the suspects was believed to be one of the ringleaders of a group of thieves that stole six new Ford Ranger cars at Phalaborwa Car Dealership in Phalaborwa in December 2017. Five of the six stolen vehicles were recovered at Limpopo River near Beitbridge before they could be smuggled into Zimbabwe on December 9, 2017. The Hawks have since come up with a raft of measures to minimise vehicle thefts and their smuggling to other countries.
