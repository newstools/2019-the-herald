IN-FORM Baroka goalkeeper, Elvis Chipezeze, has welcomed his inclusion in the Warriors AFCON 2019 provisional squad. He made 26 starts in his debut season in the South African Premiership. “To play for your country is always a dream for most professional footballers and I am really happy that I am part of the provisional squad,’’ said Chipezeze. “I worked hard and prayed for my inclusion in the team and I am really grateful the coaches back home are convinced I can add value to the team. “It is still a provisional squad and the other goalkeeper will be dropped but, as for me, I am motivated and I am confident I can make the final three. “The other three who have been called into camp have been doing very well but now competition has been increased because of my presence and I think that will help all of us to improve and it’s good for the team. “We are supposed to camp later this month but I am not stopping training on my own so that when called for duty I will be ready to represent the country.’’
