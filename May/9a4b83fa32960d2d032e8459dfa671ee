The trial of former Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) board chairman Albert Mugabe failed to commence yesterday as his lawyer, Mr Admire Rubaya, was committed at the High Court in Bulawayo. Standing in for Mr Rubaya, Mr Everson Chatambudza made an application for postponement of trial saying: “The matter in Bulawayo commenced yesterday and Mr Rubaya is a litigant. “We are seeking for postponement to May 30, for trial commencement.’’ ASked by magistrate Mr Lazini Ncube if, by proposing the new date,  he implied he would proceed with the case even if Mr Rubaya was not available, Mr Chatambudza replied in the affirmative. Prosecutor Mercy Ndingadii said the State was ready for  trial. “Since the legal practitioner is not available, the matter may be postponed to the 30th of May but it should be on record that trial should commence on that day,” The matter was postponed to May 27 for trial. Mugabe is facing charges of criminal abuse of office charges. He is accused of authorising and tendering false letters of undertaking to set off a mortgage loan facility to CBZ Bank without the board’s approval.
