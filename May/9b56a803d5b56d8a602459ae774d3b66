The Herald LONDON. — Lewis Hamilton has acknowledged that Valtteri Bottas is likely to be his main 2019 Formula One title rival after Mercedes’ perfect start to the season – but insists he wants more drivers to battle against. Mercedes have crushed the competition so far this year, making history with an ominous run of consecutive one-twos and the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday was their most impressive weekend yet with Ferrari and Red Bull unable to challenge. That dominance has engaged a Mercedes rivalry and a seemingly exclusive title fight, and Hamilton admits the battle between him and his team-mate is closer than ever and could be all season after edging back ahead in the championship with his Barcelona victory. “The biggest threat is always the person that’s closest to you,” Hamilton told reporters. “And that person is Valtteri. “But it still feels too early.” But the Englishman, who has enjoyed immense tussles with Sebastian Vettel over the last two seasons, also says he is desperate for Ferrari and Red Bull to enter the title fight. — Sky Sports.
