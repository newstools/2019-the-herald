A driver employed by the Zimbabwe National Road Administration (ZINARA) stationed at Dema tollgate in Seke was recently fined $600 for killing a pedestrian crossing the road. Mathias Sibanda was convicted on his own plea of guilty when he appeared before Chitungwiza resident magistrate Mr Nyasha Vitorini charged with culpable homicide. Sibanda risks spending three months in jail. Six months were suspended on condition of good behaviour in the next three years. His licence was also endorsed. The prosecutor Mr Tendai Katonha proved that on February 7, at around 5am Sibanda was driving a Mazda vehicle along Chaminuka Road, St Mary’s with one passenger on board. Shupikai Kanodzimbira was walking along the same road towards the same direction and upon reaching a place near Live House church he staggered to cross the road when he was hit by Sibanda and fell on the ground. He did not sustain any visible injuries but was rushed to Chitungwiza hospital where he was treated and discharged. Sibanda’s car sustained a slight damage on the front bonnet and he made a report to Chitungwiza traffic on the same day. Unfortunately, Kanodzimbira died on February 10 due to internal injuries. The State said Sibanda failed to act reasonably when an accident seemed imminent, he also failed to stop or exercise caution.
