The Herald Fashion 263 withTafadzwa Zimoyo
Fashion is art and the good thing about it is that people use it to express themselves, how they feel or show their creativeness with material. So the first Monday in May is one of the most significant events in the fashion calendar in the world. Forget about the Oscars, Grammy, MTV, Nama or Sama’s. There is the Met Gala, formally called the Costume Institute Gala and also known as the Met Ball, which is an annual fundraising gala for the benefit of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in New York City, US. It marks the opening of the Costume Institute’s annual fashion exhibit where fashion designers, artists, models, musicians and actors come together in celebration of art and the unveiling of the fashion institute’s blockbuster exhibition. Just forget about your normal “red carpet” fashion statement as this is the most prestigious one. The world over was amazed, shocked and excited about the Met Gala and locally too, we have noticed how the social media was frenzy with local celebrities. Musicians and fashionistas judging and commenting about it. Don’t you think it is high time Zimbabwe has its own version of Met Gala, just like South Africa? Now they are busy planning for the Durban July where they also showcase their creativity. The Met Gala, like I have mentioned above, is fashion’s favourite night of the year for many. “Camp” was the dress code for the gala and this theme may be elusive. It was a way of telling the celebrities on the guest list to honour the concept of “over-the-top” and, if Hollywood has taught us anything, it’s that they’re really talented. But we have our local designers who include Thembani Mubochwa, Chenna Neni and Tapfumaneyi Munenga (Coco) who know how to play with needles and cloth. They can be up to the task of our own version of Met Gala. Thumbs up to South Africa-born comedian Trevor Noah who was fantastic on the famous pink carpet. The best dressed accolade goes to Lady Gaga as she brought the pink carpet down. She killed it with her transforming one outfit into four, all while on the pink carpet, Lady Gaga perfectly married fashion and showmanship. Gaga’s outfits were designed by Brandon Maxwell. The worst dressed celebrity went to musician Frank Ocean who looked like a little boy waiting outside the principal’s office about to be scolded for a playground mishap. Maybe Ocean legitimately thought the theme was going camping. There is no other reason we can believe anyone would rock up at the Met Gala looking like this. Enough about the Met Gala. Local musician Sabastian Magacha caused a stir on social media after he posted his new look from recent fashion photoshoots. <img class="size-full wp-image-429573" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/Sabastian-Magacha.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/Sabastian-Magacha.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/Sabastian-Magacha-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sabastian Magacha Magacha wore a robe like with a jacket side feel which turned heads and sparked social media frenzy with some describing it as too feminine. Asked for comment, the “Ridza Bhosvo” hitmaker said his outfit was inspired by Jesus and that men’s robes are common in many parts of the world including Nigeria, Islamic countries and Ireland. “I am a creative person. The clothing line is one of many creative things that I am working on. The collection has various items that will be released in due time. That particular attire is mostly a suit. We decided to add a kente tail to give it an African flair,” he said. Some claim that he might be seeking attention considering that it is now the in thing in the showbiz industry. One thing people need to distinguish and understand with fashion: some outfits are meant for the ramp, runway and obviously our normal pathway and road.
