ZIFA Northern Region Division One side Golden Valley, who many thought will be the team to beat in this season, have struggled so far. They were humbled o-3 by newcomers FC Mbare National who, until then, had not won a match. Today, Kifton Kadurira’s charges take on high-flying Herentals Under-20 in a lunch hour kick-off at Morris Depot desperate to turn things around. ‘’I had a week only, to train with the boys, and that can have some effects but everything looks in order now,’’ he said. ‘’I hope we are going to have the results from now onwards as the boys are adapting to my philosophy.’’ Northern Region Fixtures Today: FC Mbare National v PAM United (Motor Action), Herentals Under-20 v Golden Valley (Morris), Karoi United v Kariba Waves (Chikangwe), Blue Swallows v Black Tigers (Manyame), Chegutu Pirates v Blanket United (Pfupajena).
