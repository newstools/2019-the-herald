A Beatrice man will languish in jail for an effective six months after being found in possession of 15 sachets of dagga which he was selling from home. Tendai Mangwanya appeared before Chitungwiza resident magistrate Mr Nyasha Vitorini charged with unlawful possession of dangerous drugs. He pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison before six months were suspended on condition he does not commit a similar offence in the next five years. The dagga will be destroyed. Prosecutor Mr Karai Katonha told the court that on May 2 at around 8pm, detectives from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Beatrice were alerted that Mangwanya was selling dagga at his residence. The detectives visited his place and conducted a search in his house where they found 15 sachets of dagga stashed in the wardrobe. Meanwhile, Brighton Matimba from Chitungwiza was fined $100 after he was found in possession of a chisel. Matimba was found guilty of possessing articles for criminal use when he appeared before the same magistrate. The court heard that on May 9, at around 10:30pm, Vincent Marigawilbert, a police officer on patrol with his colleagues at Makoni Shopping Centre, met Matimba and stopped him. Matimba then ran away and they chased after him until they caught him. After conducting a search on him, the police officers found him in possession of a metal chisel. Matimba failed to give a satisfactory reason why he had a chisel, resulting in his arrest.
