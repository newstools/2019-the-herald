PREMIERSHIP football new boys TelOne proved they can compete against the very best in the elite division after they became the first team to beat champions FC Platinum this season in an entertaining game at Luveve yesterday. On his debut, Elasto Chigora scored the only goal of the match to condemn the two-time Premiership champions to their first defeat of the season. Not even a second half penalty could retrieve Pure Platinum Play from the jaws of defeat which means they have lost top spot while TelOne recorded their second league victory. Jairos Tapera kept his cards very close to his chest in his team selection as he gave four players their debut appearance this season and they responded by dominating their opponents. After the match Tapera said he knows all in the miners camp and was confident that he was going to get maximum points.
“I have worked at FC Platinum before and I know them so we were well prepared for them and I am glad we won. “Our team is still work in progress but if we get results like these when we are building it shows we are in the right direction,” said Tapera. The Premiership newcomers showed signs of intent in the early stages, daring the champions by bettering their favoured passing game. FC Platinum welcomed back the influential midfield duo of Farai Madhanaga and Kelvin Madzongwe but the two were failing to bring the forwards into the game with the opposite midfield led by former Harare City man James Jam dominating.
