AFTER her dream to become a world champion went up in flames when she lost a tense WIBA Intercontinental super fly weight title bout to Zambia’s Alice Mbewe in Lusaka last month, Talent Nyagura will be hoping for redemption.
She steps into the ring tonight. The “Small Dynamite” will battle Ndau Chilimba of Malawi in the highlight of the Mau-Mau-promoted “Zimbabwe versus Malawi” extravaganza at Magamba Hall in Warren Park. Nyagura lost the WIBA title to Mbewe via a UD controversially awarded after all the Zambian judges went for their compatriot.
Mbewe’s trainer and boxing icon Ester Phiri was the commissioner. But, just over a month after that disappointing night at the Lusaka Government Complex, Nyagura will be hoping to get her act together against Chilimba. “This will obviously be a massive fight for my brand as I will be seeking to redeem some pride, which I obviously, lost after that defeat to Mbewe in Zambia. “I will fight for my country, my name and my stable (Mau-Mau).
“That defeat I suffered at the hands of Mbewe is still fresh in my mind and the only way I can let it fade away fast is by winning this bout against Chilimba.” Another rising female sensation Zvikomborero Danzwa will take on Euna Matoga in a super bantamweight fight in one of the contests expected to produce fireworks. Ten other fights are on the bill, with Simbarashe Hokonya scheduled to trade leather with Washington Ruvetsa in the lightweight category. Evans Usaiwevhu tackles Patson Mutengwa in the lightweight section.
