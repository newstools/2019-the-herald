The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal will test Crystal Palace’s resolve to get top dollar for Wilfried Zaha this summer. The Gunners are keen on Zaha but his £80million asking price will rule them out of the running.  Palace are determined not to let the 26-year-old go on the cheap but Unai Emery’s budget will be around the £40 million mark if they fail to reach the Champions League. They are likely to wait until later in the window before making their move — and seeing if Palace budge on their valuation.
Zaha has told Palace he wants to leave for a Champions League club — and Emery needs to win the Europa League to make it. Arsenal are also keen on getting home-grown talent into a squad that will lose Aaron Ramsey on a free to Juventus. Zaha has switched countries to play for Coteb d’lvoire but he is still classed as home-grown on Premier League quotas.
Chelsea are looking to spend big on a marquee signing this summer but they are searching for a No. 9. Zaha fits the bill for Arsenal, who could offer Callum Chambers, Carl Jenkinson or Reiss Nelson in part-exchange for any deal.
Meanwhile, Paul Pogba must demand a transfer to force through his dream move to Real Madrid. The French World Cup winner has made it clear to Manchester United that he wants to join his hero Zinedine Zidane. And Real boss Zidane has told the midfielder it has to be now or never as, like Old Trafford chief Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, he starts his own rebuild. But United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward says he does not want Pogba (26) to leave.
He believes his sale would further damage the club’s image following the nightmare end to the season that cost them a Champions League spot for next season. — AFP.
