The Herald UGANDA are not even sending their national team coach, Frenchman Sebastien Desabre, and their regular players, to the 2019 COSAFA Cup in Durban from May 25-June 8. The Cranes, who will play Zimbabwe in Group A of the AFCON finals in Egypt, have submitted a 34-man preliminary squad, made up exclusively of home-based players, for the tournament. They will take part in this year’s edition as a guest nation after they were invited to fill the vacancy created by Madagascar’s withdrawal from the Southern African championships in Durban from May 25-June 8. The squad is to be led by Police FC coach, Abdallah Mubiru, and is made up of players mainly from SC Villa, Vipers and KCCA. Included is FUFA Footballer of the Year Moses Waiswa, as well as highly-rated forward Bashir Mutanda. Uganda have a bye through to the quarter-finals in Durban, where they will take on Lesotho at the Princess Magogo Stadium on June 1. The Cranes met Lesotho in the recent AFCON qualifiers, claiming a 3-0 home win and collecting a 2-0 success on the road. The winner of that tie will face either hosts South Africa or Botswana in the semi-finals, while the losers drop into the Plate competition.  Uganda preliminary squad: Goalkeepers: Keni Saidi, Charles Lukwago, James Alitho Defenders: Jack Komakech, Paul Willa, Mustafa Kizza, John Revita, Paul Mbowa, Isaac Isinde, Hassan Musana, Fillibert Obenchan, Timothy Awanyi, Halid Lwaliwa, Mustafa Mujuzi Midfielders: Ivan Eyamu, Muzamiru Mutyaba, Shafik Kagimu, Nicholas Kasozi, Juma Sadam Ibrahim, Tadeo Lwanga, Allan Okello, David Owori, Anukani Bright, Moses Waiswa Forwards: Bashir Mutanda, Paul Mucuurezi, Nelson Senkatuka, Allan Kayiwa, Daniel Muzeyi Serunkuma, Michael Birungi Komunda, Allan Kyambadde, Juma Balinya, Patrick Henry Kaddu, Joel Madondo. — Sports Reporter/Cosafa
