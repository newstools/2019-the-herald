THE stock of Zimbabwean athlete Kundai Maguranyanga continues to rise in the United States’ collegiate track and field world. He won the MVC title for the fourth time this year following three blistering performances during the Missouri Valley Conference Outdoor Track & Field Championship at Terre Haute in Indiana at the weekend. Maguranyanga (21) is now a sophomore (second year student) at Drake University at Des Moines in Iowa. And, on Sunday, the Zimbabwean was part of his college’s track and field team’s men’s sprinters who collected 57 points with three titles to lead the Bulldogs on the final day of the Missouri Valley Conference Outdoor Track & Field Championship. Maguranyanga led an outstanding day for the Drake University men’s sprinters as he swept the 100 and 200 metres titles to become the first Bulldog to do so since 1988 and ran the anchor leg on the winning 4×100-metre relay team. The two titles came after he won the 60 and 200m during the indoor season to give him four individual MVC titles this year. Those performances helped the Drake University men’s team to finish fifth in the team standings with 87.25 points, the programme’s highest point total since 2005. UNI won the men’s title with 183.25 points. Maguranyanga won the 100m title in 10.48 seconds to be the first Bulldog to win the event since 2007, and just the fourth to do so, in the last six decades. He was the first of four Bulldogs to score in the event as Aobakwe Malau was third in 10.65 seconds, Victor Peka was fourth in 10.68 seconds and Aaron Chier took sixth in 10.70 seconds. Later in the afternoon, Maguranyanga blitzed past the field in the men’s 200m event to win in 21.31 seconds followed by Peka in second (21.70) and Malau in fourth (21.70). Malau, Peka, Chier and Maguranyanga opened the day by winning the 4x100m relay in 40.50 seconds. By winning two events and leading another to a title, Maguranyanga was named the Championship’s Most Valuable Athlete.
