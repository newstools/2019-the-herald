A Man already serving 10 years in jail for poaching a rhino has been jailed another nine years for poaching another rhino at a safari lodge in Chipinge. Godknows Mashame appeared before Chipinge magistrate Mr Poterai Gwezhira for contravening the Parks and Wildlife Act (Chapter 201:14). The court found him guilty after a witness provided overwhelming evidence against him.
Mashame is serving another 10 years in jail for killing another rhino in Beitbridge. Mr Gwezhira said the jail terms would run consecutively meaning he will finish serving the first sentence before serving the other. The State, represented by prosecutor Mr Timothy Katsande alleged that Mashame entered the safari area in July 2011 without a permit. He poached a black rhinoceros using a gaming GPS monitor, with intentions to sell it to foreign buyers.
The court heard that Mashame ran away after committing the crime and was only found after he was arrested and found guilty of the Beitbridge case.
