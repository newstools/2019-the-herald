ZIMBABWE’S junior motocross sensation Emmanuel Bako has received a timely boost ahead of this weekend’s Round Four of the Gauteng Motocross Series in South Africa. A local fast-food outlet, Chicken Hut, penned a long-term partnership with the young rider. The 12-year-old star, who is also a member of French team, EHR Racing France, will be one of the favourites to win the 85cc (Junior) Class at Smoking Pistons Race Track in Johannesburg on Sunday. Chicken Hut corporate affairs spokesperson, Tryphina Ndlovu, said the marriage between her company and Bako heralds the beginning of bigger things to come for the talented young rider. “Through the Chicken Hut’s good heart initiative, we have decided to partner our own motorcross star Emmanuel Bako in his dream to become a world icon in his field. “We believe in supporting our own people and community. Bako has proved to be a rare talent and he has already made a difference in our society. “Just like in any other country, including the First World, sport unites people and we should be involved in creating that atmosphere through partnering talented sports-persons like Bako,” said Ndlovu. Chicken Hut, who have also supported top rugby side Old Georgians, are currently identifying sporting fields and athletes who are in need of help with a view to sponsor them. Meanwhile, after competing in Round Four of the Gauteng Motocross Series this Sunday, Bako is expected to return to one of his favourite grounds — Donnybrook Raceway in Harare — next weekend. He will race in the first round of the 2019 Bogwheelers Club Championship. The Bogwheelers Club run the motorcycling sport of motocross in this country under the Zimbabwe Motorsport Federation and next Sunday, May 19, will see them hosting the opening round of their Club Championship series at Donnybrook.
