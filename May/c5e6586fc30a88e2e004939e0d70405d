Police have arrested a man who allegedly killed his ex-wife at a farm in Beatrice on Saturday last week before setting a hut on fire in an attempt to burn the body, following a misunderstanding over the upkeep of their two children. The man has been identified as Christopher Chimina (48). National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the arrest.
“He has since appeared in court at Chivhu Magistrates’ Court and was remanded in custody to 21 May, 2019,” he said.
According to police, Chimina killed his former wife at Plot 5, Silver Oak Farm in Beatrice. The two had been on separation for several months following a disput. Chimina had subsequently left the matrimonial home to live in Chinhoyi. This resulted in the wife falling in love with another man at the same compound. Sometime in March, Chimina returned to Silver Oak Farm, but did not reconcile with his ex-wife. Investigations revealed that the ex-wife went on to demand child upkeep for their two children from Chimina. On May 4, she went to Chimina’s house and a dispute ensued. Chimina subsequently killed and set a hut on fire while the body was inside. Meanwhile, police are still battling to arrest a 50-year-old Harare man, Petros Pomborokani, who allegedly shot and killed his estranged wife and brother-in-law at their Gletwin home in Harare following a protracted marital dispute in March. The whereabouts of Pomborokani, a former Ministry of Health and Child Care official, are still a mystery amid widespread belief that he could have skipped the country. Police are appealing for information on the whereabouts of Pomborokani, who is suspected to be holed up in South Africa or Namibia.
