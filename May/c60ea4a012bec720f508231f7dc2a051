Zimbabwe Swimming Board of Control chairperson, Tracey Doorman, confirmed the team yesterday. The team will be led by Zimbabwe Aquatics Union president, Mary Kloppers, and coach Debbie Wetzlar.
Doorman said the swimmers were ready to make an impact on the big stage. “We’ve four athletes participating – Paige Van Der Westhuizen, Liam Davis, Peter Wetzlar and Robyn Lee. We are expecting the team to leave for South Korea on July 17 and they will be led by our swimming president Mary Kloppers and coach Debbie Wetzlar. “We are proud and confident with the team that we are sending. We know that they are ready to compete and raise our flag high at the event,” said Doorman. The athletes will compete in six disciplines – swimming, water polo, open water, synchronised, diving and high diving events. Doorman also told The Herald the Zimbabwe Swimming Board of Control were aligning the constitutions of all the provinces in the country to conform with the requirements of the Sports Commission. She said the swimming motherboard will oversee the drafting of the new constitutions countrywide.
The process began with Mashonaland province board where the constitution has been dissolved to pave way for the drafting of a new one. “Mashonaland province will be renamed Harare province to abide by the SRC regulations that require our swimming provinces to be named under national provinces than the regional provinces that we were using in the past years.’’
