TELONE manager Joel Luphahla could revert to his role as head coach as soon as August after the Gweru-based Premiership club pledged to help him attain a UEFA-B Licence. That badge can be used as an alternative to the CAF-A badge. The former Warriors winger guided TelOne to the Central Region Division One championship which came with a ticket to the Premiership last season. But he had to be redeployed as he couldn’t meet the Premiership’s club licensing requirements as he doesn’t have the CAF A qualification. Luphahla was seconded to a managerial role with Jairos Tapera coming in as the coach. But a Germany-based sports development organisation, GeBe Education and Sports Foundation, have given him, as well as other local coaches, a lifeline after extending an invite to Zimbabweans to enrol for both UEFA-C and B badges. The training is scheduled for July 15-22 in Germany. TelOne already has a clearly defined human resources development policy which their president Lloyd Mutetwa believes will be considered before coming with a decision regarding Luphahla.
