IT’S all set for another dose of grit and gusto when the country’s top junior and senior motocross riders return to the home of local motorsport — Donnybrook Raceway in Harare — for the opening round of the 2019 Bogwheelers Club Championship series on Sunday. The Bogwheelers Club run the motorcycling sport of motocross in this country under the Zimbabwe Motorsport Federation and this Sunday will see them hosting the opening round of their Club Championship series at Donnybrook. The club secretary, Yasmin Manuel, said the event is expected to attract most of the country’s top junior and senior male and female riders who will fight for the top honours in nine classes — PeeWees (for bikers under the age of seven), 50cc, 65cc, 85cc, 125cc MX1, MX2, Veterans and Masters. And speculation may be rife on who will take that hole-shot when the first gate drops to see the 2019 Club Championship burst into action at Donnybrook on Sunday, but there is also so much more motocross excitement to look forward to. Battle lines will once again be drawn in the juniors 85cc Class where two of the country’s most exciting young riders Daiyaan Manuel (13) and Emmanuel Bako (12) will be fighting for the top step on the podium on Sunday. Bako, fresh from winning the 85cc (Juniors) Class at last Sunday’s fourth round of the 2019 Gauteng Series at Smoking Pistons in Johannesburg, South Africa, will be looking to continue from where he left off at that meet. Bako, who confirmed through his father and manager, Brighton, that he will take part in Sunday’s race meeting, is well aware that Manuel, on his day, can be a nuisance on the track at Donnybrook where he has monopolised the 85cc Class.
