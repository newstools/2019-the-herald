CAPS United coach Lloyd Chitembwe has been impressed by his charges’ character after they posted victory over Harare City on Sunday to jump into second place on the Castle Lager Premiership football log. The Green Machine, who have a game in hand, beat Harare City 1-0 at the National Sports Stadium, thanks to a solitary strike by winger Gabriel Nyoni, who scored for a third successive match. They even missed a penalty through Joel Ngodzo. Chitembwe’s men took their points tally to 13, just one shy of leaders FC Platinum, who have played a game more. CAPS United have scored nine times while they have conceded just once in a game they beat Bulawayo Chiefs 4-1 at the same venue last weekend. “We need to make sure that we retain the basic aspects and principles of the game which the boys executed quite well in the game against Harare City,’’ said Chitembwe. “I feel we should have won the game by a slightly bigger margin, especially if (Joel) Ngodzo had converted the penalty which he missed towards the end of the game. “In terms of attack, we are doing well and we have failed to score just once in the game against Highlanders and, defensively, we also conceded just once against Bulawayo Chiefs. “These are good signs and the character being shown by the boys, I am sure, can carry us towards our set objectives.” Chitembwe said the team needed to be competitive this season. “We need to be competitive this season and with the kind of concentration the boys continue to show, week in week out, I am sure we can be able to compete against the best this term. “It is still early to talk about anything but the spirit which the team is displaying is surely encouraging.” CAPS United next take on Triangle at Gibbo.
