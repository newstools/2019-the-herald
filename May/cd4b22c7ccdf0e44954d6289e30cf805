The Herald MANCHESTER. — Pep Guardiola says Vincent Kompany’s future at Manchester City is yet to be decided, moments after the captain fired the club to within a victory of the English Premiership football title. Kompany’s sensational 30-yard strike secured a 1-0 victory over Leicester on Monday night, as the champions ensured they remained in the driving seat in the title race heading into the final round of fixtures. It means Kompany can lift the English Premier League for the fourth time if City win at Brighton on Sunday, but it could prove to be his last, with Guardiola confirming talks are planned this summer over his future. “At the end of the season, we are going to talk to Vincent, clearly, he knows,” the City boss told his post-match press conference. “He is an incredible human being, an incredible person, he helped me a lot. I was sad that we could not use him a lot for the process, but we always know we can count on his personality. “This club is where it is thanks to guys like Vincent. At the end of the season, after the FA Cup, we are going to decide what is best for both parties.” — Sky Sports.
