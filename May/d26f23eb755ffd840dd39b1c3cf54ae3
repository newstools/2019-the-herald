The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United star Paul Pogba has paid a visit to Mecca as he marks Ramadan. The 26-year-old embarked on a pilgrimage to Islam’s holiest city in Saudi Arabia following the end of the football season. It is not the Frenchman’s first visit, having made the trip at the end of the last two seasons as well. He shared a pair of pictures from his visit on Instagram, alongside the caption, ‘Never forget the important things in life’. Pogba will hope the journey marks some respite after a disappointing end to the season at Old Trafford. He was the target of fans’ disgruntlement after a 2-0 home defeat by Cardiff on Sunday confirmed a sixth-place finish for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. He was told by one fan “f*** off, You’re f****** s***”, in a video circulated on social media over the weekend. Pogba faces an uncertain future at the club with Real Madrid monitoring his situation. He is one of Zinedine Zidane’s main targets this summer as he tries to around the Spanish giants following their own turbulent campaign. — The Daily Mail.
