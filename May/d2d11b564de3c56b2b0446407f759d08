The Herald LONDON. — Mauricio Pochettino has challenged Tottenham Hotspur to seize their unexpected chance to make history as they try to overturn a 1-0 deficit against Ajax in the Champions League football semi-final second leg tonight. The match kicks-off at 9pm. Pochettino is convinced Tottenham can still reach the club’s maiden Champions League final despite losing the first leg in north London last week. Many pundits and fans claim Tottenham have blown their opportunity after Donny van de Beek’s strike gave Ajax a priceless lead to defend in Amsterdam. Tottenham go into their biggest game for decades on a low note after losing 1-0 at Bournemouth on Saturday, a defeat that nearly stopped them wrapping up a place in next season’s Champions League via a top-four finish in the Premier League. It was a third successive loss in all competitions for Tottenham, who finished with nine men after red cards for Son Heung-min and Juan Foyth. Fortunately for Tottenham, they are still all but certain to finish at least fourth after Arsenal and Manchester United were both held to draws on Sunday. — AFP.
