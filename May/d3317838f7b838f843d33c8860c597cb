The Herald DODOMA. — Tanzania has become the latest African nation to announce a sweeping ban of single-use plastics, joining Kenya and Rwanda in the effort to tackle plastic pollution. A statement released by the Tanzanian government says the ban will begin to take effect on June 1. As of that date, all plastic carrier bags will be prohibited from being imported, exported, manufactured, sold, stored, supplied and used in mainland Tanzania. Visitors to Tanzania are being advised to avoid bringing any plastic carrier bags or packing items in plastic carrier bags in suitcases or hand luggage before embarking on a trip to Tanzania. To help screen out plastics moving forward, there will be a special desk designated at all of the country’s entry points, where visitors will be asked to surrender plastic carrier bags. However, the government’s statement notes that Ziploc bags that are specifically used to carry toiletries will be permitted, as they are expected to remain in the possession of visitors and not disposed of while in the country. A story from Reuters also reported that Tanzania plans to ban the production of such bags, as well as their sale and importation. — Reuters.
