FIVE months later, Zimbabwe senior netball team head coach Lloyd Makunde reckons his charges still have unfinished business with South Africa’s Spar Proteas. In a nail-biting encounter on December 3 last year, the Gems were left tear jerked as they fell 73-44 to the South Africans in Polokwane at the Diamond Challenge, finishing off in third place behind the hosts and Zambia respectively. As the rivals clash again later this week in a friendly encounter, Makunde still finds it hard to talk of what happened in Polokwane. “This will not be just an ordinary friendly match but there is history to it, a history that we want to redefine.
“What happened in December is something I cannot really describe but it is that encounter that has given us the push during our preparations,” said Makunde. The friendly encounter comes as part of the preparations for the World Cup finals.
The finals are scheduled for July 12- 21 at Echo Arena in Liverpool, England, and 16 nations will be battling for the world title.
Zimbabwe have been drawn into Pool A together with favourites Australia, Northern Ireland and Sri Lanka.
And the friendly match against Spar Proteas will be used as a grading test for the Makunde-led charges. “After an encounter with Uganda last week, I am happy our squad is building up very well because our combinations clicked very well.“
