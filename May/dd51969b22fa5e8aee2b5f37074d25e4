|THE 2019 OK Grand Challenge Horse race final fields were unveiled yesterday, with 15 runners set to take part. Stidolph Yard, as usual, brought on board the highest number with seven runners, including Castle Tankard winner, Peggson, who will be targeting a double. Peggson, who was Stidolph’s top card and ridden by top Zimbabwean jockey Brendon McNaughton in last week’s Castle Tankard, jumped from a favourable draw as the four-year-old separated himself from the rest of the field with a splendid finish in the last 200 metres of the race. Coming into the race with five wins and nine placings, Peggson has stretched his winning run to six, including the Tankard, the only Grade One race in Zimbabwe, and is now targeting the grade two  race. However, it will be difficult for the long distant runner in this race, which is much shorter. Speaking at the official unveiling ceremony, OK Zimbabwe commercial director, Albert Katsande, said they were happy to stage an event of such a magnitude again. “It is with great pleasure that we unveil this year’s edition of the 2019 edition of the OK Grand Challenge promotion, which will be held on June 1. “OK Grand Challenge is arguably one of the biggest retail promotions in the region, if not in Africa,’’ said Katsande.
