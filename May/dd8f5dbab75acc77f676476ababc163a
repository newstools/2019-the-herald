The Herald CAIRO  – The African Union said on Tuesday that Sudan’s military rulers should hand over power to a civilian-led transitional authority within 60 days. In a statement, the AU said it noted “with deep regret” that the military had not stepped aside and handed power to civilians within a 15-day period set by the AU last month. The 60 days were a final extension for Sudan’s Transitional Military Council to hand over power to civilians, the AU said. – Reuters
