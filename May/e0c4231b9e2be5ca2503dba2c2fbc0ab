Local visual artists have painted a mural of the men’s national football team’s key players in celebration of Zimbabwe’s qualification for this year’s Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Egypt. The mural, painted on a pre-cast wall in Budiriro 2, Harare, has captain Knowledge Musona, striker Khama Billiat and goalkeeper George Chigova, with a figure of a fan cheering them on. Community members were afforded a chance to print their names on the mural, cheering on the team and pledging their support. The mural was designed by Baobab Media’s Rodney Badza and was painted by Nyasha Jeche and Kumbirai Zvinavashe.
Zvinavashe said the mural was an encouragement to rally behind the Warriors. “The mural is aimed at encouraging the boys to do their best and the community to rally behind them as they play in the Cosafa Cup this month and Afcon next month.
“We hope that they do well in both trophies,” he said. To help the team financially, Zvinavashe said they will contribute part of the revenue they generate in their work towards the Warriors. “Those who hire our services after this mural will also be contributing financially to the Warriors as a certain percentage will be contributed towards the national team,” he said. The two have been on a drive to add colour in Harare, splashing murals at Theatre in The Park’s facelift and “Theatre Walk of Fame”, the British Embassy and a mural celebrating the life of the late Dr Oliver Mtukudzi in Highfield.
Zvinavashe said he hopes to work with City Fathers. “We want to continue adding colour to Harare and hopefully the City Fathers will partner with us to do murals on key main buildings. “We also hope the corporates will move with time and engage artistes in beautifying the city,” he said.
They are moving towards painting murals in other parts of the country.
