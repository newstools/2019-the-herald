A gold dealer last week appeared before a Kwekwe magistrate for allegedly shooting and killing a man who was playing snooker during a fight with his friends. Canisio Misi (36) of 6269 Golden Acres, Kwekwe, who had been drinking beer with his friends, allegedly drew a pistol and fired random shots during the altercation. Misi was remanded in custody to June 4 by Kwekwe magistrate Miss Vimbai Mtukwa. He was advised to apply for bail at the High Court. Prosecuting, Mrs Ethel Bhumure alleged that on May 12 around 9pm, Misi was drinking beer at Yellow Snake Mine Shops in the company of friends, Spencer Pande, Farai Nengure and one Isaac. A misunderstanding arose among them which degenerated into a fight. Misi then pulled out his CZ Pistol and fired random shots and one of the bullets hit Brighton Muzanarwo, who was playing snooker nearby and had nothing to do with the scuffle and he died instantly. Sensing danger, Misi allegedly rushed to Kwekwe Central Police Station where he reported that he had been attacked. Muzanarwo’s brother, Darlington also arrived at the station and reported that Misi had killed his brother. Police attended the scene and found Brighton’s body under a thatched shed with a bullet wound in the head.
