The Herald LONDON. — UEFA’S club financial control body chief investigator has referred English Premiership football champions Manchester City to the adjudicatory chamber for breaches of Financial Fair Play regulations, Europe’s governing body has announced. City were fined £49 million and hit with restrictions on transfer spending and their Champions League squad after FFP breaches were originally investigated in 2014, and UEFA began a new probe after further allegations about the same period were made in German publication Der Spiegel last year. “The Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) chief investigator, after having consulted with the other members of the independent investigatory chamber of the CFCB, has decided to refer Manchester City FC to the CFCB adjudicatory chamber following the conclusion of his investigation,” said a UEFA statement. “The CFCB investigatory chamber had opened an investigation into Manchester City FC on 7 March 2019 for potential breaches of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations that were made public in various media outlets. “UEFA will not be making any further comment on the matter until a decision is announced by the CFCB adjudicatory chamber.” — The Evening Standard.
