JUST as the cricket community has been looking for something to lift the spirits following the disappointment caused by the Chevrons last year, it appears their women counterparts are set to provide the relief. They qualified for the final of the International Cricket Council Women’s Qualifier Africa 2019. The Lady Chevrons yesterday thumped Rwanda by 82 runs at Old Hararians to set up a date against Namibia in Sunday’s final at Harare Sports Club. The hosts have won all their games against Mozambique, Tanzania and Rwanda in Group A. They still have a date with Nigeria tomorrow, but the result will be academic as they have already qualified for the final as they lead the group with six points and a healthy run rate. The Namibians, who topped Group B at the end of the round robin matches, upstaged one of the tournament favourites, defending champions Uganda. Their 10-wicket win over Sierra Leone on Wednesday sealed the deal. But it has been the way the Zimbabwean women team has been going about their business that has impressed local fans. A half century from Modester Mupachikwa yesterday set the foundation for Zimbabwe’s win. The wicketkeeper/batter played a superb innings of 62 in a match-winning total of 145 for the loss of two wickets, setting Rwanda a target they had no chance of matching at Old Hararians. Her opening partner Sharne Mayers, who has been Zimbabwe’s top run-scorer, missed out on a half century for the first time, but her knock of 40 runs from 36 deliveries was also key. In response, the Rwandans struggled to 63 for eight wickets to give the hosts an overwhelming victory by 82 runs. Tasmeen Granger took three wickets while Anesu Mushangwe and Nomatter Mutasa had two each.
