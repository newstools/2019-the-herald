UK-ZIMBABWE Netball Association have postponed the Gems’ fundraising dinner that was scheduled for tomorrow at Liverpool’s Bootle Cricket Club following a poor ticket response from the Zimbabwean community in the United Kingdom. The event, which was going to see patrons forking £25 for a three-course meal and a chance to win Netball World Cup tickets, was meant to raise funds to support the Zimbabwe senior netball team. The Gems will feature at the 2019 Netball World Cup finals in Liverpool, England, in July. UK-Zim Netball Association spokesperson, Eugene Mujuru, told The Herald that the fund-raising dinner had been postponed after they failed to secure enough tickets. “The response from the Zimbabwean community was not that good, so we decided to postpone the event to another date. ‘’We are still to come up with another date and there is a possibility that instead of a dinner event, we might just do a barbeque. “Other communities, based here, are doing that for their teams that have qualified. ‘’We will soon sit down to discuss a possible date where we can hold the event. We also realised that May 25 coincided with other events such as the 2019 Zim Archievers Awards which also draw a lot of interest within the Zimbabwean community.”
