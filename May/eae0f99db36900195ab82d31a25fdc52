Chinese Ambassador’s wife Wang Wei said she was pleased to have had a conversation with the First Lady on the country’s outstanding achievements. “We have jointly reviewed Zimbabwe’s outstanding achievements in economic development and reforms led by President Mnangagwa,” she said. “Amai briefed me about her charity work at her Angel of Hope Foundation. She is quite devoted to charity and she is playing a big role in promoting and protecting women and children’s rights.” Mrs Wang added that she greatly admires the First Lady’s devotion to charity and her patriotism. “I myself and the Chinese Embassy greatly appreciate and admire her devotion and efforts in this regard,” she said. “We are willing to work with the First Lady’s Angel of Hope Foundation to help provide assistance to local women and children as well as providing the necessary assistance to those in disaster-afflicted  areas.” Zimbabwe and China enjoy cordial relations dating back to the days of the liberation struggle when the Asian country helped freedom fighters with combat logistics and training. The two countries have agreed to enhance the alignment of development strategies, deepen cooperation within the frameworks of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and continue to orderly promote cooperation in such areas as infrastructure construction, agriculture, investment and financing.
