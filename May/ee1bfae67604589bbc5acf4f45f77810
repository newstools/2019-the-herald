The Herald LONDON. – Unai Emery is facing growing discontent within his Arsenal squad with the players said to be increasingly confused by the Spaniard’s team selections and tactics. Leicester consigned the Gunners to their third consecutive defeat with a comprehensive 3-0 win at the King Power Stadium on Sunday. Those defeats have left Arsenal’s top four hopes hanging by a thread and the Gunners now need Chelsea to slip up in their final two matches to qualify for the Champions League football via their English Premier League position. Arsenal take on Valencia in the Europa League semi-finals and entered their three-game losing streak with a confidence-boosting win away at Napoli earlier last month. The win in Naples was seen as a springboard for the Gunners but they lost at home to Crystal Palace just three days later in a error-ridden display. Emery made a number of changes for the game against the Eagles, selecting Carl Jenkinson at right wing-back and playing Mohamed Elneny in midfield with Mateo Guendouzi. Those decisions reportedly ‘‘baffled’’ the Arsenal squad, who felt they squandered a golden opportunity due to results elsewhere to solidify their place in the top four, according to the Telegraph. Palace’s win was largely down to a poor defensive display from the Gunners and Shkodran Mustafi was slated for his performance.  – Metro.
