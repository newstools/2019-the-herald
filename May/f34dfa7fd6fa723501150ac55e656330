The Herald ZIMBABWE Cricket have named an experienced side for the ICC Women’s Qualifier Africa 2019 that gets underway in Harare this Sunday. Led by captain Mary-Anne Musonda, the squad of 14 also includes her predecessor Chipo Tiripano as well as the veteran Precious Marange. Another ex-skipper, Sharne Mayers, who missed Zimbabwe’s tour of Uganda for a triangular series that also included Kenya earlier this month, has made the cut at the expense of Christabel Chatonzwa. Right-arm seamer Chiedza Mzembe, who claimed two wickets on her international debut against Namibia in January, is at 17 the youngest in the home side’s  squad. Zimbabwe, who have won all of the nine Twenty-20 international matches that they have played this year, will go into the ICC Women’s Qualifier Africa 2019 carrying the favourites tag. Their biggest challenge is likely to come from Uganda who toppled Zimbabwe for the first time to win the last regional qualifier tournament in Windhoek, Namibia, in September 2017. The ICC Women’s Qualifier Africa 2019, a nine-team event, is a Twenty-20 competition that is serving not only as part of the pathway for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup to be held in Australia in 2020, but will also help decide the participants in the next 50-over ICC Women’s World Cup to be staged in New Zealand in 2021. Zimbabwe are in Group A together with Tanzania, Nigeria, Mozambique and Rwanda, while Uganda, Kenya, Namibia and Sierra Leone make up Group B. Old Hararians Sports Club and Takashinga Cricket Club are the venues for the group matches, with the final pencilled in for Harare Sports Club.
