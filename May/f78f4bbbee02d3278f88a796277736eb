Chimutuwah hailed the programme saying it had benefited local artists in so many ways. “This is a good initiative where us as artists can cross-pollinate and share ideas as we see how best we can improve our art. We have learnt a lot of things through this exchange programme. “I was also privileged to be part of the artists who went to exhibit in Beijing China last year in October at the first edition of the exhibition,” he said. Speaking at the official opening held of the programme , Afro-Sino Cultural Exchange Association chairman Mr Franklin Asira said the idea is to unite Africans and the Chinese through art and culture. “This programme is China’s call to Africa for the development of African continent and we do our very best to bring together people of China and Africa. “The beauty of culture is that it is a universal language same as fine art and visual art. We thank Government of Zimbabwe for all the support that you have given us,” he said. In a speech read on his behalf by principal director in the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Dr Benson Dube, ICT minister Kazembe Kazembe who was meant to be guest of honour at the event, hailed the exchange programme. “Zimbabwean Government is elated by the relationship and commitment it continues to share with the Chinese Government which keeps growing from strength to strength. “As the acting minister I gratefully commend them for this vision and effort of networking our artists as the Belt and Road Afro-Sino Art Exhibition is a brainchild of the Afro-Sino Cultural Exchange Association headquartered in Kenya,” he said. The event was also graced by Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe Gio Shaochum, NACZ director Nicholas Moyo, NAGZ director Dorothy Sibanda and many other artistes.
