The Herald LONDON. — Reports that Pep Guardiola will leave Manchester City to manage Juventus are “ridiculous”, says the English Premiership football club’s board member Alberto Galassi. Guardiola led City to an unprecedented domestic treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup this season. Several Italian media outlets have reported that the Spaniard will replace Massimilano Allegri, who is leaving Juve at the end of this campaign. “This rumour is unfounded,” Galassi told Sky Italia. Guardiola signed an extension to his deal with City last year and is contracted at Etihad Stadium until 2021. — BBC Sport.
