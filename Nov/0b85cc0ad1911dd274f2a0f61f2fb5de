The Herald Herald Reporter The Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) yesterday announced fuel price increases of 11 cents and 10 cents for petrol and diesel, respectively. The price of petrol which was at $16,66 per litre is now $16,77, while diesel is now $17,53, up from $17,43 per litre. The price changes are due to the FOB (Free on Board) price movement and the revised duty regime. Zera said operators may, however, sell at prices below the cap depending on their trading advantages.
