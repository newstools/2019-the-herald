The Herald Redcliff Municipality, which is eyeing city status by 2030, is in the process of preparing a development master plan that will see the establishment of a new Central Business District at the Redcliff turn-off along the Kwekwe-Gweru highway, officials have said.
The town’s Business Development Officer, Ernest Chigwagwa said the proposed CBD will see the establishment of shopping malls, hotels, fuel service stations and residential properties such as garden flats.
He added that there will also be the establishment of light industrial parks and warehouse facilities.
Town Clerk Gilson Chakauya said Redcliff is ready for investment as it moves towards being “vibrant, prosperous, connected and sustainable”. Redcliff, he said, has the potential to expand since it has vast land to accommodate various economic activities. “The municipality is also located along the great dyke which is rich in mineral deposits ranging from iron ore, limestone, nickel and gold. These minerals present investment opportunities in the mining and manufacturing sectors with the thrust being to process the raw material locally.” — The Times-New Ziana.
