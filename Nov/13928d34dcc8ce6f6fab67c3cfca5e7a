In the semi-finals on Friday, the Lock brothers, who are both members of the Zimbabwe Davis Cup team, beat Prajwal Dev and Rishi Reddy of India 6-4, 7-6 (5) to enter the final.

This was their fifth doubles title of the year before they flew to Mozambique where they were once again conquerors on Saturday in Maputo to assert themselves as two of the top men’s doubles players in the ITF circuit this year.
