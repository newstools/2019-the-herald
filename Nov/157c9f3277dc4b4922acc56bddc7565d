Zimbabwe’s hip hop industry never disappoints and seems to bring out trailblazing female artists each year. Last year saw Kikky Badass cement her name as one of the leading acts while 2019 has seen the rise of upcoming artiste Phreshy, who released a project recently. She released a nine-track album titled “Muzambangwena”, which has been doing well online and on radio. The album was produced by Rayo Beats, Afrow Zend, DaRuler and VicEnlisted among others and it was recorded in Harare. Speaking to Herald Arts, Phreshy said the project is performing better than she anticipated. “The response is overwhelming, most people are enjoying my music and it has motivated me to keep pushing,” she said. She has had collaborations with Kikky Badass on the album. Some of her better known songs include “Married” (with Kikky) and “Sando” which is a dedication to mothers. So far, the artiste has unleashed two videos that are available on YouTube. “Some people are touched by my tracks off the EP for example Sando (Mai). Most tracks on that EP are relatable hence many people are moved by those tracks. So far I have released two videos off the EP for Ndinokakama and Sando (Mai). “I want to earn money through live performances and hosting my own shows. I have been building a fan base so I will also sell merchandise that pushes my brand,” said Phreshy. Born Herschneider Frank, the 24-year-old artist has been chasing her breakthrough since 2015 and it appears 2019 has been her best year to date.
