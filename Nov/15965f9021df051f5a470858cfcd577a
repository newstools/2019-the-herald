“Art and literature are the highest forms of expression for humankind.” This statement was made by local award-winning author Humphrey Sambo who recently launched his second book “Bobo and the three Mermaids”, which is already selling on Amazon site and selected book stores. The 113-page novel is centred on societal settings mirroring what happens in families regarding wealth, rivalry and backstabbing among other issues. Sambo – who wrote the book with assistance from his sister, Lucille – said Zimbabwean authors must be given an opportunity to fully express themselves and get platforms to compete to boost the industry. “When we were growing up, literature was among top arts genres such as music, drama and theatre. Most of the billion-dollar movies come from great novels and we should take the subject seriously. “As authors, we should be competing to be the solution to the societal problems we face rather than always complaining,” he said. Sambo, who is also the author of the popular 53-poem collection titled “Freedom Train” which speaks on societal problems and ills, said he diverted from poems to broaden his literature. “I was having a chat with my little sister one day and we decided to pen a book on what was affecting families and what was happening in the community to offer solutions,” he said. He said the book was not inspired by his family background because the story was worlds apart from his lifestyle. The book is based on young man Bobo who spends a part of his life in prison but later amasses wealth. Although he is an illegimate son of the great chief Sharu, Bobo ultimately occupies the throne after going through numerous family feuds and clashes.
