The Herald At least 70 percent of motor vehicle importers invited by the Zimra demanding “registration verification” responded to the taxman’s request on time, but the authority is not shutting the door on those yet to show up. Zimra this month recalled more than 400 vehicles to be presented at its Harare offices as the authority sought to ascertain circumstances around their importation amid a cloud of alleged flouting of import regulations. Investigations by the authority have unearthed a scam in which Zimra could have been prejudiced of millions of dollars by vehicle importers avoiding customs duty or paying less than the actual prescribed rate. In response to questions from this publication, Zimra said at least 70 percent of those invited had responded and presented their vehicles. The taxman also said it was willing to engage with those that are unable to meet its deadline. “About 70 percent of the names published in the notice responded on time,” said Zimra spokesperson Francis Chimanda. “Yes, we have received requests for extension of the deadline to November 29, 2019. However, no blanket extension will be given.”
