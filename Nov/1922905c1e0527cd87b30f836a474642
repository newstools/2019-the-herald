The Herald More than 16 000 direct jobs have been created to date since the government announced last year its intention to mobilise more than R1,2 trillion in new investments over the next five years, said President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday. Speaking at the launch of the Tshwane Automotive Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Silverton in Pretoria, President Ramaphosa said many of these investments will be located in various special economic zones across the country. The number of jobs created excludes construction jobs, indirect jobs and additional jobs from confirmed investments where projects are still under construction. President Ramaphosa said the launch of the Tshwane Automotive SEZ is yet another affirmation of growing investor confidence in South Africa. He said that with the economic situation confronting the country, people may have been tempted to think South Africa would not be able to attract investors — but about 1 500 potential investors were set to attend the second South African Investment Conference in Johannesburg yesterday. — Moneyweb.
