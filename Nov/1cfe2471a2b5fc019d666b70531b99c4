Organisers of Kadoma Braai Festival, to be held tomorrow, featuring dancehall stars Winky D and Enzo Ishall, have vowed to make the event family friendly. This comes at a time when many promoters have been failing to deliver comfortable family shows with mishaps ranging from failure to meet stipulated time while some performers go on to play dirty music while also introducing raunchy dancing. Just this weekend children could be seen sleeping on blankets spread across the lawn while waiting for Jah Prayzah who came late for a performance at Braai Out ZW held at Kingfisher Park. Tich Mharadze, proprietor of Kadoma Odyssey Hotel which hosts the show, said they will set a standard for local promoters. “Family shows are held for families to bond and have fun as a unit, they ought to be made comfortable for everyone, with clean lyrics so one can even attend with respectable members of the family, including in-laws,” he said. “Also considering we will have children who would love to see Winky D and Enzo Ishall perform, we will stick to time, so that they will be home before bedtime. “Come this weekend, Kadoma will witness a true family event.” The event will be Winky D’s first performance in the mining town in two years. Mharadze said families in Kadoma are starved of events. “We conceptualised this event with Kadoma families in mind realising that they are starved of entertainment. Now they can get a chance to see their superstars in action,” he said. For the hard-core party crowd, who always turn up late expecting to party way into the night, Mharadze has deejaying duo Gary B and Templeman to wrap up the show. “Gary B and Templeman will entertain those who want to hang around late after the main acts. These two never disappoint, they always deliver a memorable show,” said Mharadze. Kadoma’s Odyssey Hotel has created a reputation for delivering, to its community, top-notch events.
