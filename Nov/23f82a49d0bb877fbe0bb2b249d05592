POLICE have dismissed as false, social media reports claiming that they intercepted wads of new bank notes linked to Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Deputy Minister Energy Mutodi. The social media reports further falsely stated that police had addressed a Press conference announcing the arrest of some youths and recovery of new notes from a Toyota Wish vehicle in Harare. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi last week denied investigating Deputy Minister Mutodi over the said case and arresting people with a Toyota Wish vehicle. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police wishes to categorically dismiss social media posts that they held a Press conference on the arrest of occupants of a Toyota Wish vehicle with money allegedly being linked to Honourable Mutodi or some political party youths,” he said. “Police did not hold such a Press conference as falsely depicted on social media and any other statement being attributed to the police, is totally false. “If at all there was such an arrest, it would be communicated through the normal channels and not through ghost media posts.” Asst Comm Nyathi said the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) and the police were now investigating the “mischievous” posts which were believed to be part of a campaign to tarnish the Government of Zimbabwe.
