The Herald Sports Reporter THE Premier Soccer League are still to receive an official complaint about match-fixing allegations raised by Black Rhinos last week. The army side raised the red flag after losing 0-3 to Herentals last month. They have made their independent investigations and team manager Gift Kamuriwo admitted to getting a bribe to influence the result of the match. However, the domestic football authorities at the PSL and ZIFA were yet to say anything yesterday. They said the matter had not been communicated to them officially. PSL spokesperson, Kudzai Bare, said their office was in the dark about the matter. “We haven’t received any communication concerning that issue,’’ she said. “So, we cannot confirm whether the incident you are referring to has really happened or not.” Rhinos have since fired Kamuriwo. Herentals have been maintaining their innocence. They claim the allegations stem from their historical rivalry with the army side which date back to their days in Division One. The teams have played each other four times in the top-flight with Herentals winning twice, drawing once and losing one.
