The Herald South African Airways acting chair Thandeka Mgoduso has confirmed that the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the South African Cabin Crew Association issued the national carrier with a strike notice yesterday morning. Mgoduso was appearing before parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts. SAA announced on Monday that it is embarking on a restructuring process which may affect 944 jobs — almost a fifth of its employees. In response, Numsa and SACCA warned that their members are preparing for “the mother of all strikes at SAA”. Yestarday, SAA briefed SCOPA on the reasons why it failed to submit its 2018-19 annual report and financial statements, as required by the Public Finance Management Act. The delegation told SCOPA that they were prevented from tabling the report as there are reservations whether the airline can be presented as a going concern.  — Fin24.
