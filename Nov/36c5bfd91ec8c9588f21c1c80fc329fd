The Herald Arts Reporter Motor Action Sports Club has become an entertainment venue of choice for many merrymakers that enjoy going out on Sundays. Over the past couple of months, the venue has been packed to capacity every Sunday and many fun-lovers are falling in love with the outdoor entertainment venue where they cool off the heat of the season. The place brings together the who-is-who of Harare social circles and it has been chosen to celebrate notable milestone events. Spencer Madziya, who runs the entertainment hub, said he never anticipated their Sunday events to be so popular when they started the programme. “We realised that many people want to go out on Sundays, but they were failing to get an ideal venue for partying. We thought we could just accommodate a few of this segment of party lovers, but we have now realised that hordes of merrymakers are hungry for Sunday entertainment,” said Madziya. “The place has become a hive of activity every Sunday and we have put in place programmes that appeal to many fun lovers. Many socialites and artistes are choosing to celebrate their birthdays at the place and this is an encouraging development. “Big names in Harare showbiz are attending such events and we are hopeful that we will go a long way in partnering those who want to hold their special occasions at the place. This is a unique outdoor upmarket place that can brew fun activities for everyone. I am humbled by the response we are getting from merrymakers.” Madziya said the venue was putting in place a massive programme for the festive season to thank their patrons for their support throughout the year.
