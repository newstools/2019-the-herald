FOR the past 12-years, the golf course has been the second home of newly-appointed Zimbabwe Ladies Golf Union president Anne Nduku. The mother of three decided to take the sport seriously after engaging professional teacher Lewis Muridzo Chitengwa at Wingate Golf Club in 2007. She immediately fell in love with the sport and was a regular player with the Wingate Ladies every Thursday.
As she gained experience, and confidence, she moved to Borrowdale Brooke Country Golf Club where she represented the club in league matches. Nduku is a competitive golfer and has represented Zimbabwe in various regional tournaments, notably in Zambia, Botswana.
A member of the Ladies Seniors Club, Friends of Diplomats Golfers Association and Rainbow Tigers, the administrator joined the Zimbabwe Ladies Golfers Union Executive as executive officer in early 2017. After working in the banking and accounting sectors for 17 years, notably in the Railways, Kenya Airways as Station Accountant and Regional Air, where she rose to he post of Country Manager in charge of Zimbabwe and Zambia operations, Nduku saw it fit to relax at the golf course when free. In 2001, she left formal employment to start The Looking Glass company where she was financed by Century Bank.
The Looking Glass is an interior d√©cor and design business. She is married to Kidwell Dumisani Nduku, a management consultant and entrepreneur, and the couple have been blessed with three children, two girls and a boy.
They are staunch Catholics.
