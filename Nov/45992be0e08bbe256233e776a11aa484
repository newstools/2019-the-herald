Zimbabwean author Roland Bere is set to launch his second book titled “My Dear Little Daughter” on December 7 in South Africa. The book, which will be available in Zimbabwe, seeks to create dialogue between fathers and their daughters. In an interview, Bere said he was inspired by the lack of father figures in girls’ lives nowadays.
“I realised that most young girls grow up without a strong positive male figure around them,” he said.
“The father might not have enough time with his daughters, either because he is too busy or he is one of those irresponsible fathers. “This book is a guide that seeks to create that dialogue between a loving father and his daughter, where he teaches her on how to live harmoniously with others and how to be a respectable woman, especially in this patriarchal society that we live in.” The book was a guide for a 21st Century young woman who needed a positive male voice on areas of spirituality, friendship, self-awareness and culture. Bere said when he wrote the book he faced the challenge of lack of cooperation from fathers.
“There was a time that I almost gave up because the challenges that I was facing were too much,” he reflected. “When I was doing research for the book, many fathers were not really willing to share their experiences of fatherhood in respect to their daughters.” “It took a lot of time to gather enough information on how fathers relate with daughters and the topics they talk about. On the other hand, girls were also not forthcoming.”
He added: “Most of those that I approached grew up around men who were not responsible and because of that they brand all men as irresponsible and believe nothing good comes out from a man.” The Chitungwiza-bred author will soon be working with other authors on the second edition of the book.
