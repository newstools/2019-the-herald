FC Platinum believe they can rise to the challenge when they take on hosts Al Hilal in a CAF Champions League Group B opener here tonight.
The match gets underway at 9pm The Zvishavane miners met Zimbabwean Ambassador to Sudan, Emmanuel Gumbo, yesterday and told him they will make the country proud today. Club general manager, Joseph Mususa, yesterday said they had come of age and were now able to stand toe-to-toe against the best on the continent. “Come hell, come thunder, we will prove to Africa that we deserve to be called champions, as our slogan says,” said Mususa.
FC Platinum paid a courtesy call on Gumbo at his official residence ahead of their showdown against the experienced Sudanese side. “On behalf of the club, I want to thank you and the entire staff for this gesture, I take this time to assure you sir that we will do our best,’’ Mususa told the ambassador. “We play like warriors and we will not fail you and the whole nation.
“We realise that when you are here, you represent the President of Zimbabwe, who is also our patron.”
Gumbo thanked he team for paying him a visit and challenged them to fight for a positive result. “Under international law, this place is your residence as Zimbabweans and when you are here in Sudan you are the ambassadors,’’ Gumbo said. “I am sure you remember Edward Sadomba, he was a true ambassador here and I urge you to be like him.
“Tomorrow, we will be with you in the stadium, yes, we will be few but you will certainly hear our voices and indeed you shall see our national flag. “Put in your best behaviour, you are likely to be provoked, disappointed by certain decisions or actions from the hosts but never lose sight of your ambassadorial role.’’ Gumbo was once a player who featured for Gwelo United in the Midlands.
FC Platinum are now the kinds of the province and champions in the country.
