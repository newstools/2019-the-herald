The Herald Rebecca Kabaya Arts Reporter
Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) final year student, Mildred Mbira, brought colour to Herald House when she exhibited works collected throughout her studies in partial fulfilment of her Bachelor of Science Honours Degree in Visual Communication and Multimedia Design. Dubbed “Reminiscence” the exhibition, which opened on Wednesday, was a cocktail of videos, photographs, graphic designs, web designs, branding, drawings and paintings. Mbira compiled designs relating to all modules she learnt at the university. H-Metro deputy editor Charles Mushinga, who officiated at the opening of the exhibition on Wednesday evening, praised the artist for the excellent exhibition. He said multimedia designing needed patience, endurance and responsibility. “A multimedia designer creates content and information for various media including the web, television, adverts, movies and video games. “Though they work in a highly technological field, multimedia designers generally need a strong foundation in art to be successful,” he said In her third year of studies, Mbira did her work-related learning at Zimpapers. She got exposed to the practical aspect of sub-editing and was taught to manage The Herald website, video editing, graphic design, photography and advertising. The Herald interim editor William Chikoto and other Zimpapers staff members attended the event. CUT lecturer, Garikai Chikoore, thanked The Herald for playing a crucial role in providing their students a platform for practical learning.
