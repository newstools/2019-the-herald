The Herald KARATEKA Sensei Sneider Adam will this evening lead one of his students to take part in the 10th Anniversary of the Japanese Ambassadors Karate Cup in Lusaka, Zambia. The two-day tournament will have karatekas from across Africa, including two Zimbabwean athletes from Glen Norah Dojo. Adam will be taking part in his 36th tournament since he started competing. He will feature in the men’s open weight division while Tawanda Clever Nyatwa will fight in the juniors category. “I am looking forward to the tournament as I have been training very hard with my mentor and dad, sensei Wilson Adam, who is now of the Last Koga of Martial Arts,’’ said Adam. “I have got a young fighter, Nyatwa, whom I believe has got confidence to make it through. “With all the hard work at training, he is capable of bringing something home. “We will travel by road and it is good for Nyatwa who will be taking part in his first regional tournament and I want to ensure that when I stop fighting, I would have nurtured my champions and leaders who can bring results. “It’s a development strategy, so even if he doesn’t bring medals back home, I know I will have a champion for the future.’’
