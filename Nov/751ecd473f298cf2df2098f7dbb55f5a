Listed tyre distributor and retailer, National Tyre Services Limited (NTS) has opened a new fitment centre in Msasa industrial site as it expands its distribution network. This comes months after the company re–branded its Samora Machel and Chinhoyi branches, as well as re-modernised
its Cripps Road branch in Harare’s Graniteside. NTS commercial director Albert Ushe said the company is strong-minded to get nearer to its customers and the new branch proved the company’s new image and model of branches. “On a prime and accessible location, the offering exhibits the company’s commitment in offering conveniently customer centric and innovation-driven premium tyre solutions. “The Msasa branch resembles the new NTS image and model of branches,” he said. Mr Ushe also said the company injected about $2 million into the project and
was still expecting more expenses to emanate during the period of finalising the project. He said the company created a property division to grow the business and is indexing all its revenue in United States dollars to hedge the business against inflation. The Msasa branch is targeting the surrounding industrial area and the company is expecting more revenue to be generated through the branch. The new NTS branch offers 3D computerised wheel alignment and wheel balancing services. The company has so far opened 14 branches across the country which provide new tyres, rethreading, tubes and various tyre management solutions. For the period ended June 30, 2019, the group’s revenue improved by 133 percent to $8,6 million, which was 42 percent above the company’s budget. NTS experienced shortages of foreign currency, steep increases in year-on-year inflation and reduced aggregate demand as businesses and consumers adjusted to the challenging economic environment.
