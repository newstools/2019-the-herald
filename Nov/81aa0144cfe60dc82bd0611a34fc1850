The Herald Labour unions are threatening to bring air travel in South Africa to a near standstill to force the loss-making state carrier to meet their demands for higher wages and job security, testing the government’s resolve to get its finances back on track. Two labour unions representing more than 3 000 workers at South African Airways have been on strike since November 15 after the airline rejected their demand for 8 percent raises and announced plans to cut 944 posts, forcing the cancellation of most flights. Now the National Union of Metalworkers is engaging its members at other airlines and companies that service the industry on whether they should stage sympathy strikes. The government’s approach to resolving the standoff could indicate how President Cyril Ramaphosa’s administration will tackle the thorny issue of bringing bloated wage bills at other state-owned companies under control. — Bloomberg.
