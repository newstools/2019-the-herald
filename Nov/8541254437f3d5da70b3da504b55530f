The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter Black Rhinos………………..(0) 0 Yadah Stars ………………… (1) 1 THEY still believe in miracle these Miracle Boys. And, yesterday, they moved from the bottom of the table after a shock win over Black Rhinos at the National Sports Stadium. Coach Genesis Mangombe believes they can survive the chop. “We are happy and if we continue to collect maximum points, we will survive,’’ said Mangombe. “Our game against Black Rhinos was the most difficult one considering that we shared the spoils in the first leg. “We came with the intention of unsettling them, in the opening minutes, which we managed to do and got the goal. “Rhinos are not easy opponents and we expected a tense match but after we scored from the free-kick our defence was resolute.’’ The only goal of the match was scored by Mkosi Mhlanga, whose free-kick, gave Rhinos goalkeeper Ashley Reyners no chance. Allen Gahadzikwa could have equalised for the army side but his header lacked the power after some good work by Wellington Taderera. “We tried hard but it happens, they did well and we need to look at the next games,’’ said Rhinos coach Herbert Maruwa.
