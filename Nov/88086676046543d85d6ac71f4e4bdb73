Minister Ziyambi said this while officially opening the three-day conference on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Value addition for Business Competitiveness and Sustainable Development in Africa in Harare on Wednesday. “With the launch of the National Intellectual Property Policy in 2018, a ‘pro-IP attitude’ is being encouraged in Zimbabwe in order to promote innovation and value addition for business competitiveness and economic growth,” he said. “As an initiative to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the country’s vision 2030, the Government of Zimbabwe is in the process of reforming its investment environment.” Government has adopted the Education 5.0, a model for higher and tertiary education to increase the production of goods and services and value addition.
