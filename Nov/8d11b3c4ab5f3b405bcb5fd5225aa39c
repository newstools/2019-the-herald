The Herald The petrol price, for both 93 and 95 grades, will be cheaper by 13c a litre from today.

The cuts, announced by Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe, are largely thanks to a stronger rand during the past month. South Africa imports more than 60 percent of its oil, which is priced in dollar. A stronger rand means the imported prices in dollar gets cheaper.

Yesterday morning, the rand was trading at R14,73/$. From Wednesday, 95 unleaded petrol will sell for R16,08 a litre in Gauteng, and R15,44 in coastal areas.
