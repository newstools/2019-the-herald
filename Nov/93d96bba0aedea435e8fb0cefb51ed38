HARARE’S Friendly Academy player Tinotenda Muskwe is trying to break into France after he was invited for an assessment by Marshall Munetsi’s side Stade de Reims. The 19-year-old has been in France for the past three weeks.
The striker is hoping to complete the giant leap into the European professional football circles by joining the Reims reserve team. Friendly Academy, which is credited with facilitating Zimbabwe international Munetsi’s initial breakthrough to South Africa, recently secured a move for defender Eddington Gwindi to Spain Lower Division Side Terrassa FC. Gwindi won a development contract with the Spanish fourth-tier side and is now set to leave the country as soon as his visa application is completed. One of the academy’s directors, Patridge Muskwe, yesterday said they were excited by the developments. The academy ended the year in style after dominating their opponents at the Harare Elite Junior Football Development League 2019 Awards Ceremony. The Raylton Sports Club-based side were crowned overall champions after scooping the Under-14 and Under-18 league titles.
A number of their players also walked away with individual prizes, while the Under-14 coach Tendai Matekenya and his Under-18 counterpart Patridge Muskwe, were voted the league’s top coaches in their categories. Trust Madziva and Tendai Chirara were the best goalkeepers in the Under-14 and Under-18 leagues. Another Kuvarega and Godfrey Master from Ajax Stars Youth Academy were the joint Golden Boot winners in the Under-14s.
Tafadzwa Chisamba finished at the top of the scoring charts in the Under-18s league.
