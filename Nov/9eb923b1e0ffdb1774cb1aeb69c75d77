Motivational writer Geoffrey Chaparadza has launched a new book titled “Grace Upon Grace” which explores Christian doctrines and philosophies. The book was recently unveiled in Harare at a colourful ceremony that brought together motivational authors and ministers of the word. Chaparadza said he was humbled to unveil his fourth book with the blessings of people from various walks of life. “I am humbled to see popular names from various sectors gathering for this launch. I have unveiled this book at a time when many people are starting to put together their plans for 2020. This book will guide Christians on how they can live a Godly life and have abundance that comes from living in the ways of the Lord.” The book explores various topical issues in Christian life. In his opening dedication of the book, Chaparadza notes: “For sin shall not be your master because you are not under the Law but under grace. Grace is one of the most important words in the Bible and the most important word for your Christian life.  It’s the secret of Christian living.” He dedicates the book to members of his ministry Christ life Covenant Church and Christians at large. In the book, he relates the grace of God to various Christian fundamentals like the blood of Jesus, Passover, justice and the knowledge of God. Chaparadza said the book will be available in many book shops soon and encouraged readers to always appreciate the grace they get from God in abundance. “God is gracious and there are many things that we get, not out of our goodness but from the grace of God. We should always thank God for that grace. The book is handy for all those who want to understand the grace of the Lord.”
