The Herald Rebecca Kabaya Arts Reporter Organisers of the annual Miss Twins competition have taken a new approach to include a segment of male participants, which will see it running under the banner Mr and Miss Twins Zim this year. Founding director Sarah Dee said the pageant was aimed at showcasing the importance of teamwork hence the inclusion of men in the competition. The pageant is running for the second year after Mitchelle and Michaella Chipoyera scooped the grand prize last year. “It is a platform to empower young women. “Twins take to the ramp while at the same time showcasing what we call the ‘Big Seven’ — love, togetherness, teamwork, sharing, peace, partnering and breaking a new idea into a product,” she said. Sarah Dee said the competitions will be held on December 14 with a fund-raising dinner slated for December 12 at the Rainbow Towers Hotel in Harare. “We are hosting a fund-raising dinner for the 2019 edition under the theme ‘If you empower women you have fed the nation’. “We have faced a number of challenges like fake promises when sponsors pull out at the last minute, which is why we have decided to have this dinner so that we can be able to get support from corporates.” The winners of this year’s edition stand a chance to win a university scholarship to China and other prizes yet to be announced.
