THE past six months have seen musicians releasing new projects across all genres. Artistes have been working hard to push their albums on the market using various platforms. Zimdancehall had Seh Calaz releasing “Love Story”, Soul Jah Love dishing out “Zvihombe Zviri Pandiri”, Willis Watafi’s “Uhuru/Independence” while Alexio Kawara came out of hibernation with a new offering. Jazz crooner, Victor Kunonga, also broke his five-year jinx and released “Ndatsva.” Gospel musician Matthias Mhere offered “Greater Than Solomon” and mbira songstress, Hope Masike, released “Exorcism of a Spinster”. In sungura, Nicholas Zakaria, Paradzai Mesi, Somandla Ndebele, Peter Moyo and Brian Samaita released albums. However, most albums have so far not had a real impact on the market. They seem to have lacked the ‘magic’ to sustain their market life before dying a few days into their birth. A few songs that lasted and made noise on the domestic market took a combination of artistes, meaning collaborations saved the day for most musicians. Zimdancehall musician Freeman collaborated with sungura singer Alick Macheso on the hit song “Ngaibake” off the former’s album “Gango”. The collaboration saved Freeman’s album which could have died within days of its release. Although gospel singer Mambo Dhuterere is doing well with “Dare Guru” on the domestic scene, he has had collaborations with Seh Calaz, Matthias Mhere and Trymore Bande over the past months.
