THE popular Monday night Jam Session, which had taken a long break, returns tonight at City Sports Bar in Harare with a number of emerging and established musicians expected to take to the stage. The Jam Session seeks to nurture talent and create a platform where artistes can exchange notes on various issues. City Sports Bar entertainment manager Yasin Dhala said the Monday Jam Session has been repackaged with a lot of activities to benefit musicians being added to event. “There was a time when we stopped the Jam Session mostly because of rising operational costs to host the event. “Remember we have artistes coming from some of the furthest parts of country and those musicians needed to meet travelling expenses. “Jam Session had literally grown into a national event as we were receiving requests for participation from artistes as far as Beitbridge, Bulawayo, Mutare and other places out of Harare, hence the need to find ways of handling them. “We have managed to put in place systems to accomodate everyone when the Jam Session restarts tomorrow (today),” he said. Yasin said in the past musicians and revellers were failing to understand the idea of behind hosting such an event. “Jam Session provides a platform for artistes to showcase their various talents and have a place where they can share ideas. “It should not be taken as a full concert. This is a stage where musicians get some time to sample their music and other talents. “This also a platform where promoters can identify music outfits they may want to promote in future. Many artistes have benefited from the previous sessions and some have emerged to be bigger names as we speak,” he said. Yasin urged musicians to participate in the Monday Jam Sessions saying they do not segregate on the type of music or performances. Mark Ngwazi, Franco Slomo, Ammi Jamanda, Vedu, an all-female ensemble and some surprise acts will tonight grace the revamped Jam Session.
