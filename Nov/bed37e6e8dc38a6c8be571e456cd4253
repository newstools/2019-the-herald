The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Chippa United might have been on the losing side against champions Mamelodi Sundowns on Sunday but new Zimbabwean coach Norman Mapeza was looking on the bright side after their elimination from the Telkom Knock-out. “Well done to my boys, nobody gave us a chance, but for us to take Sundowns to extra-time was good. It gives us hope going forward,” Mapeza said after the 2-2 draw at the Nelson Mandela bay stadium. Sundowns won 4-2 on post-match penalties and now meet Lamontville Golden arrows in the semi-finals.
“There were plenty of positives. The way we moved the ball around, the way we defended and attacked. I think if we had managed to finish the chances we got in the first half, we would have wrapped up the game,” said the ex- Zimbabwe international “Our squad is a little bit thin in terms of quality, but I think our guys applied themselves very well.
“I am not frustrated, it would not be nice of me to get frustrated after such a performance. The first goal was a penalty, the second one . . . everybody saw what happened.” It was a mistake by veteran goalkeeper Patrick Tignyemb who spilled a routine cross to the feet of Gaston Sirino to equalise. Chippa now turn their focus to their Absa Premiership clash at home to Kaizer Chiefs tomorrow. — Spersport.com
