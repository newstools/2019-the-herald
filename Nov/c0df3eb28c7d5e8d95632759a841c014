The Herald Cement maker, PPC Zimbabwe said yesterday it is targeting to enter into a partnership with investors for the provision of up to 16 megawatts of power through solar energy for its two plants in Bulawayo. This is intended to ensure uninterrupted supplies to the company’s plants, which have been equally affected by the prevailing power shortages in the country.  Power utility, Zesa Holdings, has since mid-this year been forced to  ration power as production at its main hydro-power plant dwindled due  to water shortages, while the main thermal station, due to old  age, experiences constant break downs. PPC Zimbabwe, via an expression of interest, said it wanted to get  into a solar power purchase agreement, with a firm that is able to  provide a combined 28 hours battery backup cover for its two plants, one in Colleen Bawn and the other in Bulawayo. The two plants have combined annual capacity to produce 760 000 tonnes of cement. “As part of its drive to use renewable energy, the company is  interested in harnessing solar energy at its Colleen Bawn and Bulawayo  factories,” the cement maker said. — New Ziana.
