The Herald The African Union Commission (AUC) has announced the arrival of an observation mission for parliamentary elections scheduled for tomorrow in the Republic of Mauritius. AUC chairperson Mr Moussa Faki Mahamat, dispatched this short-term mission to observe and report on the electoral process. The African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) is led by Dr Speciosa Kazibwe Wandira, former Vice President of the Republic of Uganda and Chairperson of the AU Panel of the Wise and Co-chairperson of FemWise. The AUEOM comprises ambassadors drawn from the Permanent Representatives’ Committee (PRC) of the AU, members of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP), election administrators, civil society, media and electoral experts. The deployment of an AUEOM to Mauritius demonstrates the AU’s commitment to supporting peaceful, democratic and credible electoral processes in its Member States by providing an objective assessment of the process. This is in line with Aspiration 3 of Agenda 2063, which aims to ensure good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, justice and the rule of law on the continent. The conduct of peaceful, democratic and credible elections is widely recognised as being critical to the achievement of Agenda 2063 and the AU’s vision of an integrated, peaceful and prosperous African continent. Relevant AU instruments such as the 2007 African Union Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, the 2002 OAU/AU Declaration on Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa and the 2002 African Union Guidelines for Election Observation and Monitoring Missions, as well as Mauritius’s legal framework and international commitment for democratic elections will guide the Mission’s activities. — AFP.
