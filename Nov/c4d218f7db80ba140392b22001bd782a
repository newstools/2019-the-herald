The Herald Gold edged down to a one-week low yesterday after the United States and China expressed willingness to sign an initial trade deal by year-end, boosting market sentiment and driving investors to higher-risk assets. Having fallen for the previous three sessions, spot gold was down 0,3 percent at $1 457,03 per ounce at 1201 GMT, after earlier touching its lowest since November 18 at $1 455,90. US gold futures were down 0,5 percent at $1 456,90. “The ultimate threat of a full escalation into a trade war, with bans and boycotts, is off the radar screen at least for the moment,” Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said. “The markets are being comforted by recent (trade) developments. That’s why equities are high,” he said, adding firmer stock markets are keeping gold prices range-bound between $1 450-$1 480. European shares rose for the second straight session following reports that Washington and Beijing were very close to an initial trade deal. Adding to the positive mood around the trade negotiations was the weekend announcement that China would seek to improve protections for intellectual property rights, a move seen to address a sticking point between the parties. — Reuters.
