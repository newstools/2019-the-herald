The Herald An average Zimbabwean family required at least $3 160 in October this year to meet its basic needs for it not to be deemed poor, a 4,2 percent jump from $2 192 the previous month, data released yesterday shows. The jump reflects a continued increase in the prices of goods and services, after the figure jumped from $1 827 in August.
“The TCPL ((Total Consumption Poverty Line) for an average of five persons stood at $3 159,52 in October 2019. “This means that an average household required that much to purchase both food and non-food items for them not to be deemed poor,” the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat) said. “This represents an increase of 44,2 percent when compared to the September 2019 figure of $2 191,62.”
The TCPL is commonly referred to as the Poverty Datum Line (PDL). — New Ziana.
