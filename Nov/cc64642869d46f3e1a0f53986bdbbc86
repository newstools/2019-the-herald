Zimbabwe’s Under-21 netball team have lost out on the opportunity to play regional counterparts South Africa.
The Zimbabwe Netball Association are said to have failed to raise funds for the trip. The Young Gems were invited to take on South Africa’s Spar Baby Proteas as curtain raisers during the Spar Challenge International Netball Test Series between South Africa and England this weekend. However, the team didn’t travel as the cash-strapped national association could not afford to cater for part of the expenses for the trip. The South Africans had committed to help Zimbabwe meet the other part of the expenses.
The event is running from tomorrow until Sunday in Cape Town, South Africa.
It was also going to be a good platform for the coaches to assess and identify potential players ahead of the 2021 World Youth Cup qualifiers set for next year. Zimbabwe participated in the previous edition of the tournament in Botswana.
Posting on their Facebook account on Tuesday, Netball South Africa confirmed Zimbabwe’s withdrawal. “Due to unforeseen circumstances Zimbabwe’s U/21 netball team has withdrawn from the 2019 SPAR Challenge taking place in Cape Town.
“We are, however, pleased to announce that Lesotho has confirmed their participation for the three matches against the Spar Baby Proteas, 29 November to 1 December.”
