ZIMBABWE will not be fully represented at the 20th edition of the Alfred Dunhill Golf Championships.
Only three players expected to take to the field at the Leopard Creek Golf Course, designed by Gary Player, in Mpumalanga, South Africa, today. The trio of Scott Vincent, Ryan Cairns and Mark Williams are set to compete in the first tournament of the European Tour for the 2020-21 season. Alfred Dunhill is the opening event of the schedule for the next Race to Dubai — just a week after the 2019 season curtain came down this past weekend. Vincent will come in as a previous winner on the Asian Tour. Williams finished the past season in the top 50 of the order of merit standings while Cairns was a reserve. Zimbabwe could have had another player had Sean Crocker, who tees off at 6:30am, not shifted allegiance to represent the United States. He spent his junior and amateur careers playing under the Zimbabwean flag.
Played over 72 holes of stroke play, with a cut after 36 holes, the top 65 professionals will remain to finish the final 18-holes.
A total of 156 professionals — half from the Sunshine Tour and half from the European Tour — are expected to converge for the tournament that has a purse value of £1.5 million.
