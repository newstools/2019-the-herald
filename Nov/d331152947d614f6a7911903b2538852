The Herald Mukudzei Chingwere Sports Reporter Harare City ……………….. (1) (2) TelOne ……………………… (2) (2) THIS was a classic and, just as well, it finished in a draw. The two teams gave as much as they got in this Castle Lager Premiership battle at Rufaro yesterday. The hosts needed a last-gasp goal to get a point. King Nadolo was at his best all afternoon and scored two goals in the first half to set the tone. But Lloyd Chitembwe’s men twice came from behind to ensure a share of the spoils. First, it was William Manondo before captain Marshall Machazane scored right at the end to force a draw. The tactical astuteness of the two technical benches was on show but at the end of the match TelOne coach, Rahman Gumbo, felt his charges deserved full points. “We had done our homework nicely, and to be frank we deserved a win, but we are in the same situation like Harare City and they never give up, they showed they want to survive. “Tough like to my boys, some results are hard to swallow, but it happens in a game, it is unfortunate it happened in the last minute for my players. “I have young players, they are still on a learning curve, (but the) relegation battle continues, we still have games to play,” said Gumbo. Chitembwe felt one of the goals they conceded should have been avoided. “There was a collision between the goalkeeper and the defender. It could have been avoided because we talk about these things on a daily basis but the boys are learning and I am satisfied with the result. It is an important point. I am very happy with the point considering the fact they are also in the relegation fight. “It was going to put us at a disadvantage if they had collected maximum points,” said Chitembwe.
