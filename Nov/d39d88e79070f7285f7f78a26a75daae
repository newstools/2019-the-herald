ZIMBABWEAN professional golfer Visitor Mapwanya was crowned the 2019 B and E champion after an eleven-under-par-277 total at the Lakowe Lakes Golf and Country Estate in Lagos, Nigeria, at the weekend. This was the 28-year-old Renco Mine-bred player’s second title on the West African Tour after having won it in 2017.
And, at the weekend, Mapwanya pumped his fist into the air as his ball dropped down the centre of the cup, extending his lead over Ghana’s Emos Korblah to five shots. Mapwanya overcame a rocky final round start to power to victory.
This came just weeks after playing second fiddle to Ghana’s Vincent Torgah at the First October Championships at the Port Harcourt Golf Club in Rivers State in Nigeria. Mapwanya has finished inside the top five in each of his last three starts at Lakowe in Lagos, Nigeria, including consecutive top-10s in the last two seasons.
