BOTTOM-PLACED Ruwa face another tough battle in the Glow Petroleum Rainbow Amateur Netball League this weekend when they host Platinum Queens at Chiremba grounds on Sunday. With relegation slowly becoming a reality for the club, which is sponsored by Ruwa Council, the team’s technical department say they remain bullish of surviving the dreaded chop. The league have confirmed five teams will be relegated with the same number gaining promotion from the regions. Last year, the new league did not demote any team to the First Division. However, Ruwa coach, Clive Karonga, says they will fight to the very end. “It’s a tough game considering we are playing a top-three team and we are anchoring the log table. ‘’But a win will give us confidence and inspire us to do well in the remaining matches. “We are treating the match seriously. “If we manage to win all our remaining games we will survive relegation,” said Karonga. Ruwa will be banking on some of their stars such as goal attack Thombinse Bengesi, centre Lorrain Nyamukuwa and Janet Amondi. They face a buoyant Zvishavane-based side who are in third place and last weekend emerged victorious in the top-of-the-table clash against Zimbabwe Defence Forces Queens. Platinum Queens beat ZDF Queens 45-39 in a tension-filled match at Bethany community grounds in Zvishavane. During their stay in Harare, Platinum Queens, who are four points behind second placed ZDF Queens and eight adrift of the pacesetters, will also play Flow Angels at Glen View New Hall on Saturday.
