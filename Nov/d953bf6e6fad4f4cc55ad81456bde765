The Herald Albert Marufu in LONDON, England FORMER Zimbabwe youth international Walter “Ringers” Musanhu will early next year launch a football academy in Zimbabwe. This follows the success of his four-month-old Jadel FC Academy in Beijing, China. Musanhu said he will be assisted by his UK-based brother Chamu to set up the academy in Harare. Chamu, a Dynamos legend, is now based in Liverpool, England, where he is now a football scout and holder of a UEFA B coaching licence. “I am hoping for a greater future for kids both in Zimbabwe and China through Jadel Academy. “The academy in Zimbabwe, which I will run with my brother Chamu, will be more to do with scouting players for various foreign leagues. “It’s going to be an elite academy that is going to take the players from the streets. “We are planning a new system that will run things differently. There will be cultural exchange programmes involving kids from both countries. “The project will certainly be a success. I have seen God. I am a true testimony of the existence of God. “God is alive and if you put Him first, in whatever you do, you will succeed,” said Walter Musanhu. He said he will be enrolling for a UEFA B Coaching licence in Germany in February next year. The former defender, who quit his job as head coach of Ole FC juniors’ team to establish Jadel FC together with Mexican co-founder, Neto, is impressed by the growth of junior football in China. The academy’s age-groups range from Under-5s to Under-12s and Walter Musanhu and his Mexican partner hope to progress them to Under-14s. “I am so much into junior football development having played for all national age-group sides and also coming through the youth system of big clubs such as Dynamos in Zimbabwe. “Football is growing in China and the parents take the sport seriously.”
