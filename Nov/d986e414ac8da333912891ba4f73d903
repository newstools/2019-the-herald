The Herald Herald Reporter Zimbabweans need to brace for EcoCash, which totally dominates mobile transactions, going offline from 9pm on Saturday to 9pm on Sunday, while a major upgrade is installed. EcoCash said the upgrade was meant to improve the mobile money platform’s performance by increasing capacity, enhancing security and offering more automated self-care services for its clients. “The EcoCash system upgrade, for which critical work has been going on over the past several months, will commence on Saturday evening, and is scheduled to be completed on Sunday evening,” said a company spokesman. “The upgrade will result in improved platform performance, increased system capacity, enhanced transaction security and many other enhancements to the current system.” EcoCash handles millions of transactions per day, and is the largest mobile transacting platform in the country. It is a part of Cassava Smartech Zimbabwe, the fintech and digital smartech company listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. With many people having embraced mobile money payments, especially through EcoCash, many businesses that do not have Point of Sale (POS), are set to have a very quiet Sunday, and in any case, the large “unbanked” block of Zimbabweans who rely on using EcoCash for just about every transaction are going to have to shop early at the weekend.
