After sending him the picture of new notes circulating on social media, Dr Mangudya told The Herald that the central bank will investigate the matter. He said the issuing bank will be fined heavily. “Preliminary evidence suggests the money was released through the formal banking system and the perpetrator will be heavily fined,” said Dr Mangudya.
