THE Zimbabwe National Army will host their annual fundraising charity horse race at Borrowdale Park today with five runners nominated for the 1 800-metre race.
Lily Blue will headline the line-up. In the Mood, Penny from Heaven, Arte and Ineffable are part of the small field in a race which was cancelled early this month due to incessant heat that affect horses. The Kirk Swanson yard will dominate the final field on a day where several apprentices will take part. Swanson will provide four of the five runners for the main race of the day. The race will be interesting in that the highest-rated Lily Blue is from the Bridget Stidolph stable. The uniformed forces are looking to raise funds through the race meeting to support the five charities that fall under the armpit of the Commander ZNA’s Charities Fund. The five charities are Tsanga Lodge Rehabilitation Centre, ZNA Widows and Orphans Benevolent Fund, ZNA Schools Welfare Trust, Army Patients Welfare Fund and ZNA Benevolent Fund. ZNA Charities head of secretariat, Livy Msipa, said the horse race will be the final event on the ZNA Charities fundraising calendar. “The ZNA Charities race will bring the curtain down on our fundraising calendar. ‘‘We have held so many events and we would like to thank Zimbabweans for supporting us in our efforts to uplift the lives of the needy,” he said. The ZNA Charities Fund was established in 1997 to alleviate the plight of the underprivileged members of the organisation and their dependants.
