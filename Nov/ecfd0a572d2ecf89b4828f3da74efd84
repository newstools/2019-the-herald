The Herald LONDON — Frank Lampard forged his reputation as a player on his ability to arrive late to good effect but it turns out he is a manager who cracks the whip in the quest for punctuality. Lampard has imposed a strict disciplinary code behind the scenes of his Chelsea revolution and a list of fines, framed and hung on the wall inside the training ground features a whopping £20,000 penalty for players who are not on the training pitch in time to start a session. Those rolling in late for team meetings can expect to be fined at a rate of £500 per minute and those not on time for treatment, medical appointments or to board the bus for a match-day departure will be fined £2,500. Phones ringing during a team meeting or meal will cost Chelsea’s first-team players £1,000, as will the wrong attire on match-days. Players failing to report an injury or illness ahead of a day off or within 90 minutes of training will be relieved of £10,000. Fines are monitored and collected by Lampard’s coaching staff and doubled if not paid within 14 days with all funds going towards charities and team activities. The Chelsea fines sheet also reveals Lampard has banned agents from the training ground, unless on official business and that players must inform the club if they intend to travel abroad, even on scheduled days off. Perhaps not surprisingly, Chelsea insiders note time-keeping has not been a major problem this season. — Mailonline.
