HARARE City Hornets have missed a huge opportunity to rub shoulders with continental basketball powerhouses at the FIBA Women’s Championship Cup due to lack of funds. The annual contest is scheduled for the Cairo Indoor Stadium in Cairo, Egypt, from 6-15 December.
But, the Zimbabwean representatives have since withdrawn from the 12-team tournament after failing to secure funding for the trip. Coach Andrew Chitauro and his team were supposed to confirm their participation by November 20 but failed to do that.
City Hornets chairman, Sunny Mbofana, said everything became complicated after FIBA Africa changed the venue for the championships at the last minute. The tournament had initially been scheduled for Madagascar.
“I can regrettably confirm that Harare City Hornets are out of the FIBA Women’s Champions Cup scheduled for Egypt next week,’’ he said. “We had planned to go to Madagascar but a last-minute switch in venue complicated matters.
“At the end of the day, we couldn’t get funding to go to Egypt. It is quiet demotivating, on the part of the girls who worked so hard to book the place.
“We hope to make it next time.” HBA Fixtures Men Tomorrow
