BLACK RHINOS yesterday ended a 17-year wait to see one of their players among the country’s best football stars after forward Wellington Taderera made the cut. Midfielder Gift Kamuriwo was the last player from the army side to make it onto the calendar back in 2002 when the team finished as runners-up to Highlanders that season. Yesterday, 24-year-old Taderera ended that after capping a fine season in which he scored on his Warriors debut after coming on as a substitute in a 3-1 victory over Mozambique in a CHAN qualifier. “I think I had a decent season in Black Rhinos’ colours. I am also happy I managed to get a Warriors’ call-up,’’ said Taderera.
“But there is always room for improvement. “I am more than happy to get onto the calendar. This was not going to be possible without efforts from my teammates.
“My coach (Herbert Maruwa) and the whole technical team, as well as the executive, have been marvelous.
“Without their support, maybe, I would have been doing something not related to football. I am forever grateful for what the team has done for me.”
Black Rhinos secretary-general, Wellington Mabhiginye, said Taderera’s selection was a sign the club was moving in the right direction.
