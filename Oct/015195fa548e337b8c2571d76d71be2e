THE Zimbabwe Under-14 national cricket side have stepped up their preparations for the annual Momentum Cricket Week scheduled for December 7-11 in Pretoria, South Africa. Teams participating in the age-group tournament, organised annually by Cricket South Africa, play declaration 20-over and 50-over formats during the five-day event. Zimbabwe Cricket have since selected a squad of 13 players picked during the selection trials in the capital two weeks ago.
The team will be under the guidance of David Mutendera and Denford Kumundati, who is the assistant coach and team manager. A number of Chevrons, including Brendan Taylor, Kyle Jarvis, Chamu Chibhabha and Tarisai Musakanda, passed through the Momentum Cricket Week. “This is a longstanding relationship between CSA and ZC and the tournament has over the years brought through most of the players who have gone on to play for the senior national team,” Kumundati said.
