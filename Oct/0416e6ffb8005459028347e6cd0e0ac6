Losses in the market’s top capitalised counters weighed down the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) reversing gains achieved in the prior week resulting in three of the benchmark indices closing the week pointing southwards. In the week to Wednesday, the primary indicator, the ZSE All Share Index gave up 3,79 percent to close settled at 233,72 points as the market see-sawed in the week.
