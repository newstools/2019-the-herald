THE country’s top motor racing drivers and bikers converge at the home of local motorsport — Donnybrook Park in Harare tomorrow for the main circuit racing season-ending Turbo Solutions Africa Race Day. This year has seen the organisers of main circuit racing successfully hosting their National Championship race meetings either at Donnybrook or in Bulawayo despite the current economic challenges in the country.
The events have been well supported by the local motorsport enthusiasts. Temba Mazvimbakupa of Motorsport Zimbabwe said tomorrow promises to be another fun-filled day at Donnybrook as most of the country’s top drivers and bikers have already confirmed their participation at the event. Mazvimbakupa has also urged the country’s motorsport enthusiasts to come to Donnybrook in their thousands tomorrow.
“This is the final main circuit race meeting at Donnybrook for the 2019 season, and we are expecting a huge competitor and spectator turn out to end a very successful season. “Motorsport is growing in stature in Zimbabwe, thanks to all the sponsors, officials and spectators who have made this possible. “We also have dedicated organisers and competitors who have been giving their all in terms of seeing that motor racing does not die a natural death in Zimbabwe and that is why we have been able to successfully host these race meetings in Harare and Bulawayo despite the harsh economic climate,” Mazvimbakupa said.
