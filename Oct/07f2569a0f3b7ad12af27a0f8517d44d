SPAIN is becoming a favourite entry point into Europe for many young Zimbabwean football players. Another prodigy, Eddington Gwindi, yesterday joined the track after he was invited for trials by Spanish lower division side Terrassa FC. Gwindi is a product of Harare-based Friendly Football Academy who took Zimbabwe international Marshall Munetsi to South Africa four years ago. The former Watershed student is expected to be in the European country for the next month. Terrassa FC are based in Barcelona and play in the Tercera Division which ranks as the Spanish fourth tier. This is the same division where Zimbabwe Under-23 goalkeeper Martin Mapisa is plying his trade with a club called Velez. One of the Friendly Football Academy directors, Patridge Muskwe, said Gwindi was a talented 21-year-old left-back. “We are happy that one of our players has been invited for trials. He is such a good player and I am sure he will acquit himself well. “Eddy has been with us since the age of 13 and we have seen him developing into a player that he is today. “I think he is one of the best left-footers that we have had at the academy. “We have been in contact with these guys from Spain for some time so they decided to have a closer look at him,” said Muskwe. Gwindi left for Spain yesterday and is expected to get down to business from tomorrow. Unfortunately, he had to travel alone because the invitation came at a short notice and the Academy could not raise enough money for air tickets for an official to accompany him. Spain is becoming a favourite destination with many young players. Apart from Mapisa, there is also midfielder Abubakar Moffat. Goalkeeper Panashe Kazamba also had a trial with Spain’s Segunda Division (Second Division) side Malaga this year. Muskwe said two other Friendly Football Academy players — Tafadzwa Samuriwo and Innocent Manhangira — were also in line for trials in Europe.
