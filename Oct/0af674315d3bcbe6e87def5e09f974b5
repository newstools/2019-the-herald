The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE third meeting of the 2019-2020 Zimbabwe racing season is on today when the AFZ Charity Handicap, over 1800m, is held at Borrowdale. Heir Line is tipped to take the honours. Born from Dynasty, out of a Jet Master mare, won last season’s 1900m Republic Cup. Heir Line has won five times from 1600m to 2000 metres and has been placed twice in his two previous starts over 1450m and 2700m. The Kirk Swanson yard runner will, however, not be alone as there will be competition from Fereeq, who has managed some places in the Independence Trophy, the OK Grand Challenge, and the Republic Cup. Fereeq, a seven-year-old gelding by Nadeem (AUS), has won five races in South Africa from 1400m to 1600m, but is yet to get first position at Borrowdale after five starts. Arte, Wolves Among Sheep and Yerman will also be part of the action. Arte is from the Kirk Swanson stable, while Bridget Stidolph and Gokhan Terzi bring in Wolves Among Sheep and Yerman. Arte, a six-year-old mare by Ideal World (USA), has so far won seven races in South Africa from 2200m to 3200m and placed second from three starts at Borrowdale. Wolves Among Sheep by Philanthropist (USA), out of a Western Winter mare, is a five-year-old gelding and has won four races from 1600m to 1800m.
