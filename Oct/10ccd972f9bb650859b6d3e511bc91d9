The Herald Zimbabwe and the European Union have commenced negotiations on a new Economic Partnership Agreement, which is expected to further enhance trade ties. The current EPA is now in its 8th year of implementation, and a comprehensive agreement would boost bilateral trade and investment flows, improve the business and investment climate and stimulate Zimbabwe’s economy by diversifying exports to the EU. Other Eastern and Southern African countries that have commenced the same negotiations are Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles. The EU said the new negotiations seek to broaden the scope of the EPA beyond trade in goods towards a more comprehensive partnership that also covers trade related areas such as services, investment, trade and sustainable development. — Business Reporter.
