The Herald COTTON production is on a recovery path following significant injection of funds into the crop’s production for the 2019/20 agricultural season, a local cotton company, Southern Cotton Company (SCC), has revealed. To complement the already in traction Presidential Input Scheme, Southern Cotton Company has offered to sponsor at least 50 000 hectares worth $25 million. The funding is expected to be spread throughout the lowveld areas like Muzarabani, Rushinga and the whole of Mbire district, while targeting other areas including Shamva and Mutoko. The firm is also eyeing to set its footprint in Gokwe and Sanyati in the Midlands. Cotton production plummeted in recent years attributable to low prices, poor funding and only last year the significantly funded cotton production fell victim to severe drought which was El Nino induced. According to the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA), cotton output declined by 52 percent last season due a severe drought although the level of funding had increased. Southern Cotton Company Managing Director Caos Nzenze, told our sister paper The Sunday Mail that he is hopeful that the sector is set for revival in the approaching season on the back of increased financial support. “We have mobilised resources worth $25 million to grow cotton on at least 50 000 hectares. The funding has mainly been directed to traditional lowveld areas that grow cotton. The initiative is designed to complement government‘s efforts in resuscitating the cotton sector in the country, which will significantly contribute to critical foreign currency earnings,” said Mr Nzenze. Mr Nzenze indicated that preparations for the forthcoming cotton season were at an advanced stage and would surpass last season’s funding. — Business Reporter.
