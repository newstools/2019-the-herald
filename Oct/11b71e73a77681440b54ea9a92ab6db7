The Herald LONDON. — Oil slipped to around $61 a barrel yesterday, falling for a second day, pressured by expectations of a rise in US crude inventories and doubts that OPEC and its allies will cut oil output further in December. US crude inventories are forecast to rise around 700 000 barrels in weekly supply reports, the first of which is due at 2030 GMT from the American Petroleum Institute (API). Russia’s deputy energy minister said it was too early to talk of deeper output cuts by OPEC and its allies. Brent crude LCOc1 was down 57 cents at $61,00 a barrel at 1400 GMT, having fallen 45 cents on Monday. US West Texas Intermediate CLc1 crude fell 86 cents to $54,95. “Doubts about OPEC+” are weighing on prices, said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch, referring to the future of a supply-cutting pact between the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other nations including Russia. — Reuters.
