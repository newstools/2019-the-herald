The Herald MANCHESTER. —  Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reportedly expressed to the squad that he fears he will be sacked if they continue under-performing. Solskjaer’s men slumped to a 1-0 defeat at embattled Newcastle, where 19-year-old Matty Longstaff’s goal on his Premier League debut sent the visitors into a tailspin. It is now 11 matches in all competitions since United last tasted victory on the road, with the side entering the international break 12th after managing two wins from their eight league games.  UK paper The Sun claims that Solskjaer labelled the display against the Magpies as “embarrassing” in the dressing room and “warned them the axe could fall on him” if they lose to Liverpool in their first match back after the international break. United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward recently backed Solskjaer despite poor form, but the Norwegian told his players “you’re going to get me the sack” following defeat at St James’ Park. And Solskjaer had a stark warning for his players too, he apparently “told the players their own futures were on the line. — The Daily Star
