The Herald LONDON. — Britain yesterday revised the tariff regime that would come into force if it leaves the European Union without a deal, making 88 percent of total imports by value eligible for levy free access. Seeking to balance the need to keep consumer prices down without destroying domestic producers, Britain also said under a new “exceptional review process” it could make changes to the regime from day one if needed. “The UK is a free trading nation and British business is in a strong position to compete in an open, free-trading environment,” Trade Policy Minister Conor Burns said. — Reuters.
