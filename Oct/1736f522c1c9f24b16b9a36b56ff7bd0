The Herald Gold eased yesterday after jumping 1 percent in the previous session as progress in US — China trade talks limited further gains, and as caution set in ahead of this week’s US Federal Reserve meeting. Palladium meanwhile continued a record run linked to supply shortages to hit another all-time high. Spot gold was down 0,1 percent at $1 503,52 per ounce, while US gold futures were 0,1 percent higher at $1 506,80 per ounce.
Traders are watching for further clues on the outlook for monetary policy at the Fed’s October 29-30 meeting, at which the US central bank is widely expected to agree to cut its benchmark interest rates for the third time this year. — Reuters.
