The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga  Sports Reporter CRANBORNE Bullets could claim the ZIFA Northern Region Division One Championship with a win against relegation-threatened Grain Tigers at their 2 Brigade Barracks tomorrow. The Army side were delayed from popping the champagne by a stubborn Chegutu Pirates who restricted them to a 1-1 draw during a mid-week encounter at Pfupajena. But they could be crowned by collecting maximum points tomorrow. Nesbert “Yabo’’ Saruchera also won the championship with Flame Lily in 2014. Saruchera’s side have 66 points, 10 better than second-placed Black Mambas, with four games to go. Mambas, who had leading marksman Leroy Ndlovu increase his tally to 18 goals during midweek, can only manage 68 points if they win their remaining four matches. Cranborne Bullets will take their points tally to unassailable 69 with a win tomorrow. They will, however, miss the services of Prince Mutasa and Blessing Gurupira, who are suspended.
