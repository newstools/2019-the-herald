The Herald Arts Correspondent Gospel diva Linia Mhomwa, affectionately known as “Vessel” in music circles, has dropped a new single titled “Ndakamuona Jesu”, which is accompanied by a sizzling video. The single, recorded at Your Sound Africa Studios, and the video, which was shot in Marondera, were directed by Angel Arts. In an interview, Mhomwa said the song was inspired by Nigerian contemporary gospel musician Frank Edward’s popular song “I See Him”. “This is a song which came into being after listening a lot to ‘l see Him’ by Frank Edwards,” she said. “This song has got to do with a relationship with the Lord. After being born again, l personally desire to be like Christ in character; that is in dominion, creativity, authority to situations, sicknesses and so on; living an upright life.” The song signifies how Mhomwa is growing and maturing in her music over the past few years, as it is rich in both sound and lyrical content. Mhomwa said she was happy about the way the track has been received so far. “I am really humbled by the support I am receiving from fans,” she said. “Barely a week since the track has been released, the song is enjoying airplay, and the video is speedily gaining viewership on YouTube.” Mhomwa said fans should look forward to at least one or two more videos before the end of the year from her, and should keep their ears on the ground for other upcoming projects. She is expecting to participate at the Zimbabwe Female Gospel Artists Association launch to be held at the Harare Gardens on November 2. Mhomwa released her first album “Unstoppable Preacher Volume 1” in 2005, which was followed by “Unstoppable Preacher Volume 2 in 2006. In 2011, she dropped another album titled “Result Praises and Worship”, followed by “Handidi Nhamo” in 2016, which proved to be popular among gospel fans and it brought her into the limelight. Her single “Mamonya naJesu”, which featured Prudence Katomeni, catapulted her to greater heights in her career.
