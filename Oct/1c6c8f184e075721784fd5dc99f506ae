Midfielder Pasca Manhanga was the star of the show and scored in the third minute with a powerful effort. This followed good work from Young Warriors striker Delic Murimba and the lively Timothy January. The hosts doubled their advantage through Collins Dhuwa who benefited from the industry of veteran forward Allan Tavarwisa. Herentals failed to create a single scoring chance in the first half despite Salif Cheya showing some flashes of brilliance for the visitors. Murimba put the match beyond the visitors with the third goal after a defensive mix-up. The ball had bounced awkwardly in front of Blessing Maunganidze and fell kindly for Murimba who fired home in the 49th minute. Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva conceded his team were outplayed by the rampant hosts. ‘’We had a very poor show and conceding three was very bad for us,’’ he said. ‘’There were lot of factors surrounding our defeat and the high temperatures here at Gibbo played a very big part. ‘’My boys also had the Chapungu game on their minds because survival is our main aim and we are not worried about our early exit from this competition.’’ Triangle coach, Taurai Mangwiro, saluted his men for keeping alive their interests on a number of fronts. “We did well to score early, we managed the game well and our movement going forward was excellent,’’ he said. ‘’We have too many games in our campaign, chasing all three fronts and it’s always trick if we don’t manage the energy levels of the players well. ‘’Having won the Cup last season means we would love to defend it and better last season’s league position while also doing well in the African Safari.”
