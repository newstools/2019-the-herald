The Herald Rebecca Kabaya Arts Reporter Playwright Tsungai Noel Murerwa, popularly known as Seke Mutema, has come up with vibrant play titled “Harsh Realities” for students at St John’s High School Chikwaka. The play was directed by one of the school’s teachers and was staged at their arts centre. In an interview, Seke Mutema said this particular play is different from all the other plays he has written before. “This play is special and unique because it is not done on a conventional stage. The synopsis of the play is that of a girl called Chiedza who is the protagonist. She marries a man who uses charms and encounters spiritual attacks at his home. “The family wanted her to join their satanic cult and she goes out of her way seeking for a breakthrough and after a long struggle she is delivered by an Anglican bishop. The play has a happy ending,” he said. He said the play was for free and it was out of his desire and wish to see students grow into the arts. “I want to stimulate arts culture in these children as they grow so that they understand it because not everyone who has the opportunity to get a degree. “People have the wrong conception as they say only science subjects can give you a bright future whereas a lot of people are earning a living through the arts,” he said. A lower Six student at St John’s High School said the play helped them to discover their hidden talents. “This play helped us to boost our confidence on stage and to discover new abilities that we were not aware of. Arts gives one open doors to exposure through socialisation. The play has taught us a lot of things because it touches on tradition, religion and also embraces modernity. Seke Mutema has also written popular plays like “Hot Water Bottle”, “Ganyau Express” and a film titled “The Post Man”.
