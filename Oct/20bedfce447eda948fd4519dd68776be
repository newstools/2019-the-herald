The Herald The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe  (RBZ) said on Friday its latest issue of Treasury Bills floated this  week got less than half of the $150 million it sought to raise to  finance government operations. It issued the 365-day paper, its fifth TB issue since the central bank  resumed the public auctions, last week. Results of the offer show that the RBZ got total bids amounting to $72  million, and only allotted $51 million. The highest interest rate on offer was 45 percent, lowest 12 percent  and average 15,49 percent. This is the second under-subscription of long-term TBs in a row after  another for $300 million only secured $81 million last week. Market watchers said this was an indication investors were less keen on  long-term paper, compared to short-term TBs. Previous RBZ offers of short-term TBs a few months ago were heavily  over-subscribed by investors. —  New Ziana.
