LEADING professional golfer, Scott Vincent, made the cut again at the Mercuries Taiwan Open at Taiwan Golf Club in the Asian Tour at the weekend. The former Chapman Golf Club member was part of the 121-player field and finished in 19th place. Vincent had rounds of 72 and 74 before he rounded off the final two rounds with scores of 72 and 71. The 26-year-old pocketed US$9 427.50 for his efforts. He finished tied with Khalin Joshi, Miguel Carballo and Kosuke Hanamoto at the course that proved quite challenging for many of the golfers. Vincent is now ranked eighth on the current order of merit with earnings of US$251 643.84 from 11 events he has taken part so far this season. He is one of the top contenders every week and came close to getting his breakthrough Asian Tour win at the Shinhan Donghae Open two weeks ago. He finished third. Vincent needed to finish no worse than third for a chance to qualify for the WGC-HSBC Champions. Defending champion Adison da Silva finished second to winner Yongcharoenchai Suradit of Thailand who took home US$180 000. The Mercuries Taiwan Masters is the longest running full-field event on the Asian Tour, having been part of the schedule since 2004.
