BLACK Rhinos midfielder Wellington Taderera has demanded maturity from his teammates ahead of their Chibuku Super Cup quarter-final clash against Ngezi Platinum Stars at Baobab this afternoon. Taderera has had a good season, culminating in his call-up into the national team. He was away with the Warriors last Saturday, when Black Rhinos suffered their worst defeat, a 3-0 loss, at the hands of relegation-haunted Herentals. “Ngezi Platinum Stars are one of the best teams around,’’ he said. “They are particularly dangerous when playing at home.
“If one looks at their statistics, when playing at Baobab, they will see that they are a difficult club to beat.
“We need to be at our best to upstage them. This is a game of wits and maturity comes to play,” he said. Chibuku Super Cup Quarter-Final Fixtures
