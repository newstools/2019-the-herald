THE Sports Commission have given the Zimbabwe Netball Association up to November 1 to respond to the several allegations levelled against them by their stakeholders. This comes after a group of netball stakeholders submitted a petition to the Sports Commission early last month expressing concern over how ZINA were running the game in the country. They raised several issues, including lack of transparency, accountability and allegations the netball mother body had different constitutions. ZINA then made their submissions to the Sports Commission, in response to the issues raised, after the latter asked them for their response. “The SRC Board, in light of the many controversies affecting the Zimbabwe Netball Association (ZINA), has resolved to institute the appropriate disciplinary action against ZINA in terms of Section 30 of the SRC Act,’’ the SRC said in a statement. “ZINA has up to Friday, 1st November, 2019 to respond to the several allegations levelled against it.’’ Part of Section 30 of the SRC Act, which deals with discipline of the registered national associations states that; “(1) Where the board considers that any registered national association— (a) has ceased to operate as a national association; or (b) has failed to comply with any provision of this Act; or (c) has conducted itself in a manner which is contrary to the national interest; the board may, after affording the association concerned an opportunity of making representations in the matter, do either or both of the following — (i) suspend all or any of its officers; (ii) direct the Director-General to strike the association from the register. “(2) Where the board has taken any action referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of subsection (1) the Minister may on the recommendation of, or after consultation with, the board appoint a committee to administer the affairs of the association concerned.”
