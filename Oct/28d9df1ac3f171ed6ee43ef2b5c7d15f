THE Harare Province Exide Sevens Rugby Series defending champions Pitbulls started their title defence on a high note when they collected nine points after the first round at Belgravia Sports Club over the weekend.
Pitbulls are in Group D with Hatcliffe, Police Defenders and Zimbiru. They beat their opponents 54-0, 19-7 and 34-0.
Last year the Jeffrey Madhake-coached Pitbulls side, who were also the national Under-21 champions, clinched the title ahead of established clubs such as Harare Sports Club, Old Georgians and Old Hararians. The 2019 season is promising to be a tough one as all the big clubs like Old Hararians, Old Georgians and Mutare Sports Club managed to win convincingly in their groups as well. Madhake was happy with their opening matches and believes they are on the right path in preparing future national team players for both the Cheetahs and Sables. Supported by Sports for Life, who also specialise in boxing, Pitbulls have several former Churchill High School students. Results
