It was a fun-filled weekend at the rebranded entertainment hub Electric Quench (formerly Extra-Mile Leisure Spot) as the venue officially opened. A cocktail of entertainment over two days that included performances from Beverly Sibanda, Baba Harare, The Goodfellaz, Progress Chipfumo, dancehall stars Kinnah and Jah Signal, Guspy Warrior, Dadza D, Garry B and Templeman left merrymakers spoilt for choice. With the stellar line-up, the venue managed to pack up their two opening events. Located a stone’s throw away from Mbudzi roundabout along the Harare-Masvingo Road, the venue lit up the area. The venue is now being run by Joem Enterprises. Spokesperson Joe Munyebvu said they had aligned their operations in line with the changing artscape. “We are rebranding to reinvigorate the space and re-invent it to be one of the top entertainment spots in the country,” he said. “We are currently renovating the space to match current top-class standards. Our events will fuse the old and the new so that there is a bit of everything for everyone.” Manyebvu said they are mixing up performance to cater for everyone. “We are also trying to mix it up from the usual type of musician that used to perform here, not that we are sidelining them but they are being complemented by artistes from other genres.” At its peak, Extra Mile used to host top musicians among them Alick Macheso, Sulumani Chimbetu, Jah Prayzah, the late Dr Oliver  Mtukudzi and Tongai Moyo among many others. Family shows have always been the venue’s biggest strength due its vast space and friendly environment. Business has, however, been on the decline, thus the recent closure which paved way for Electric Quench.
