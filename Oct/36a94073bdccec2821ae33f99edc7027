The Herald SANTIAGO. — The International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its global growth forecast to 3,2 percent in 2019, according to a report released here yesterday. In April, the agency forecast a 3,3 percent expansion in global gross domestic product (GDP), but slow growth in the first half of the year, trade and technology disputes, and uncertainty regarding Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union led to the downward adjustment. The IMF’s most recent World Economic Outlook report also downgraded the forecast for 2020, from 3,6 percent to 3,5 percent. A breakdown of countries showed growth results were positive for several developed economies, though weaker than expected for emerging markets and developing countries. — Xinhua.
