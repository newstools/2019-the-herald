The Herald Tharisa CEO Phoevos Pouroulis says getting Special Economic Zone status at Karo Zimbabwe is a critical step in the development of what could become a world class vertically integrated platinum group of metals (PGM) operation. Last week, the Zimbabwe Special Economic Zones Authority (Zimseza) declared a portion of Selous, covering areas with mining grants issued to Karo Zimbabwe Holdings, as a special economic zone. “It is hereby notified that in terms of section 20 (1) of the Special Economic Zones Act [Chapter 14:34], the Zimbabwe Special Economic Zones Authority, has declared a portion of Selous measuring 50 667 hectares as a special economic zone,” reads last Friday’s Government Gazette. “The SEZ status, as well as the completion of the initial resource classification, are key milestones prior to investing in the various phases that a project of this scale requires for it to succeed. We look forward to working closely with Zimseza and the Government of Zimbabwe, together with the local, regional and national stakeholders, as well as our financial partners, to bringing this project to fruition,” said Mr Pouroulis.
