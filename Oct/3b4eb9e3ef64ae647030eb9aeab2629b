The Herald United Airlines Holdings Inc said on Friday it is extending cancellations of Boeing 737 MAX flights until Jan. 6, as regulators continue to extensively review proposed software changes to the grounded plane. The company said it expects to cancel more than 8 000 flights for October, November, December and the first few days of January and that it will monitor regulatory updates and make adjustments accordingly. Among other US airlines that operate the MAX, Southwest Airlines Co  has cancelled flights through January 5, while American Airlines Group Inc  has extended cancellations of Boeing 737 MAX flights through January 15. “We have co-operated fully with the FAA’s independent review of the MAX aircraft, and we won’t put our customers and employees on that plane until regulators make their own independent assessment that it is safe to do so”, the company said in a statement. The fast-selling 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since mid-March while Boeing Co updates flight control software at the centre of two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people within a span of five months. Boeing is planing a revision of the 737 MAX software to take input from both of its angle-of-attack sensors in the anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes and has added additional safeguards. — Reuters.
