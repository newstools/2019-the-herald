Motswana musician Naledi Kaisara — popularly known as Slizer — is in the country. The singer arrived yesterday from Botswana to attend sungura musician Mollen “Senator” Tichareva album launch that is slated for East Point in Harare tonight. The album, titled “Mhinduro Ibasa” is Tichareva’s fourth and features Slizer on the song “Watora Moyo”. Speaking after her arrival yesterday, Slizer said she was delighted to work with Tichareva and was looking forward to the launch. “It is great to be back in Zimbabwe. I love this country and I appreciate the talent that you have here. I did a song with Senator and I am here for the launch of his album. The song is good and I know people will like it,” said Slizer. Tichareva’s manager, Gift Petro, said all was set for the launch. “We have a number of local musicians that will come to perform at the launch. It is going to be an exciting event because we have a mixed bag of music. We are happy that Slizer is in the country for the event. She is excited to be part of the launch,” said Petro. Tichareva was among a crop of promising sungura musicians and he is hoping that the new album will take him to a higher level. Last year he had a colourful launch of his previous album at the same venue and this year he has promised a bigger occasion. “We want to beat the standards we set last year. We are doing this at a time when the economic environment is challenging, but we will do our best to surpass last year’s level. A good launch is an opportunity to celebrate the coming of a new album in a memorable way,” said Tichareva. After tomorrow’s launch, Tichareva’s team will set a date for a similar event in Botswana where they intend to market their duet with Slizer. Tichareva said the Botswana event will be held in the next few weeks. It will help them reach out to a foreign market and they are optimistic to make a mark outside the country.
