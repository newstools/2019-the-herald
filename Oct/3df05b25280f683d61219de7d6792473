Government through the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has floated $150 million worth ofÂ  Treasury Bills as it seeks to raise funds for ongoing and pipeline Government programmes. The treasury bills have a maturity period of one year (365-day Treasury Bills). Treasury Bills are short-term financial instruments issued by the government treasury to be paid at par-value after a particular maturity period, often a maximum of a year. They are considered the safest investments since backed by the Government.
