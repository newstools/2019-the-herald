MBIRA sensation aMadhuve Sasha will add traditional flavour to Braai Out Festival slated for Saturday at Kingfisher Park in Harare. aMadhuve Sasha will join Jah Prayzah and disc jockeys Hush, Harshai Bhana, Killer Priest, Merciless and King, among others. Celebrated radio presenters Chamvary and MC Rue are expected to host the event where Jah Prayzah’s son, Mukudzei Jnr, will entertain children during the afternoon. Mukudzei Jnr will join his father when he takes to the stage, in what appears to be a first in the history of music festivals in the country. aMadhuve Sasha said she was geared for the Saturday event.
“We have new music that will be performing at Kingfisher Park. The new music was supposed to have hit the streets a few weeks ago but we decided to shelve the album for the time being. “I am sure it will be ready early next year,” she said. Jah Prayzah’s manager, Keen Mushapaidze, said:
“The best is what we promise come Saturday, like always, those coming should expect a good show from JP and the entire band. “It is also highly likely that Mukudzei Jnr will join him on stage during his performance after an afternoon of mixing and mingling with people, especially children.
“Mukudzei Jnr will be hosting various children challenge games.” Braai Out Festival organiser Nigel Chinovhiringa said preparations were on course with everything going according to script.
“We are geared up and look forward to yet another great show. We urge people to come out early, as we have a number of activities for family and children during the afternoon. “We also have an exciting line-up for the evening session,” he said.
This is the third edition of the Braai Out Festival, which comes hard on the heels of the two preceding highly successful events.
