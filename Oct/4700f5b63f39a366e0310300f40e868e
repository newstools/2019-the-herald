The Herald PUNE. — India galloped to an embarrassingly one-sided victory by an innings and 137 runs after dismissing South Africa for just 189 in their follow-on innings soon after tea on the fourth day of the second Test cricket at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune yesterday. Fast bowler Umesh Yadav claimed two of the last three wickets to finish with 3-22 and six wickets in the match while left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja claimed 3-52. South Africa’s fate was effectively sealed in the morning session when they slumped to 74 for four after being asked to follow-on by Indian captain Virat Kohli. Opener Dean Elgar dominated the run-scoring with 48 from 72 balls with eight boundaries but his counter-attacking innings came to an end with a catch at long-on off the bowling of Ravi Ashwin shortly before the break. Aiden Markram completed a nightmare test match when he was dismissed lbw second ball — for the second time. A four-ball pair. Ishant Sharma was the successful bowler this time, Umesh Yadav, in the first innings. Theunis de Bruyn (8) was unlucky as he glanced a poor delivery from Umesh down the leg side but instead of collecting four runs he found the outstretched left glove of the diving wicketkeeper, Wriddhiman Saha. Captain Faf du Plessis opted for the blockathon approach but perished for five from 54 balls when a thin edge against Ashwin was juggled and caught at fourth attempt by Saha. Three further wickets fell in the afternoon session and the match was speeding to a conclusion until Vernon Philander (37) and Keshav Maharaj (22) renewed their successful liaison with a stand of 56 following the 109 they added for the ninth wicket in the first innings. — AFP.
