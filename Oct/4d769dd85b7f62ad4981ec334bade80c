The Herald Microsoft shares surged after the company scored a major victory in securing a milestone, $10 billion Pentagon contract for cloud computing services. But the contract – unthinkable for Microsoft even a year ago – will likely come at a cost, legal and internal. Amazon.com, the market leader in cloud services, is considering a challenge to the award of the contract to Microsoft’s much smaller Azure business, citing President Donald Trump’s interference in the bidding process, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon had been widely considered the front-runner because of its superior size and previous cloud contract with the Central Intelligence Agency. — Moneyweb.
