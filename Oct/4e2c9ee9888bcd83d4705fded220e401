ZDF Queens coach Joel Sibanda is convinced his side has what it takes to challenge for the Rainbow Amateur Netball League title. They continued with their winning ways yesterday when they defeated Black Rhinos 66-27 at Josiah Magama Tongogara Barracks. ZDF, playing away from home, dominated the encounter as they controlled the game almost in all departments. Goal shooter Sharon Bwanali teamed up with captain Caroline Matura upfront to inspire their team to success. Centre Patricia Mauladi enjoyed a good game throughout, even when she was moved to wing attack towards the end of the match. “We know Black Rhinos’ players, so I told my girls this is a derby since we are sister teams. “Then I told them that we have to be serious and make sure we win this game so that we continue with our winning streak because if we want to stay in the race of the league, we have to take each and every game seriously,” said Sibanda. The visiting side made sure they put their foot down from the start and were 17-8 ahead in the opening quarter. They went into half time leading 33-14 and made sure they remained in the lead after the break to emerge winners. Sibanda was full of praise for his side, which recently lost top goal shooter Mercy Mukwadi, who left for the UK. “I think the departure of Mercy did affect us, but in netball you have to move on and be confident with the other players you have.’’ Bwanali netted 48 goals for her side and got the golden hand, while Mauladi was player of the match for her outstanding performance. Black Rhinos coach Francis Parwaringira said the departure of one of his shooters Stembile Chitiva, who also left for the UK, had created a huge gap for his side. Chitiva was one of the eight players that travelled to UK as part of the developmental programme for ZINA during the World Cup in Liverpool in July. ZRP Mambas Queens also posted another win yesterday when they dispatched Golden Valley 70-25 in Patchway, Kadoma.
