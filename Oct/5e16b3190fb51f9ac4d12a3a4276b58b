The Herald Tertiary institutions in Zimbabwe  should come up with innovative ways to assist local authorities in waste  management, an official has said. Africa University vice chancellor Professor Munashe Furusa said this  recently while addressing stakeholders during a clean-up campaign held at  the Mutare Provincial Hospital (MPH). The AU is one of the institutions in the province spearheading waste  management programs and mobilising resources clean-up campaigns. According to the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), urban centres  in the country generate about 165 million tons of waste per year, which  ends up in open dumpsites posing serious health hazard to citizens. “Cleaning our environment and managing waste is not a choice but a  shared responsibility and hence as institutions of higher learning we  should adopt waste management systems which helps in the correct  disposal of waste,” said Furusa. He said that was in sync with the move by the Ministry of Higher and  Tertiary Education to build innovation hubs in all tertiary institutions  across the country to meet the developmental agenda. “Universities and other tertiary institutions must be innovative and  should carry out cutting edge researches that bring technological  solutions to management of waste and protection of the environment,” he  said, adding at least 10 institutions in the country had since started  constructing innovation hubs. — New Ziana.
