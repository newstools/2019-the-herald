The Herald LONDON. — Jose Mourinho claims Manchester United’s tactics skewered Liverpool as he bizarrely claimed Jurgen Klopp “liked meat but got fish”. Kop boss Klopp certainly looked crabby as VAR decisions went against his English Premier League football leaders in Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. But former United boss Mourinho believes Klopp’s biggest beef will be Liverpool failing to cope with United’s “solid” defensive tactics. Klopp’s men floundered in the first half, Marcus Rashford’s opener for United being awarded after video replays, just before VAR ruled out a Sadio Mane equaliser. But midfielders Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came off the bench to get Liverpool out of a stew. And it was fit-again Lallana who tapped home to put Klopp’s men six points clear of Manchester City, albeit the first time Liverpool have failed to win in their nine Premiership games this season. And noting Liverpool’s poultry first-half display, Mourinho said of Klopp: “He likes meat and he got fish. “United, with the limitations they have at the moment, they played with five at the back, were solid and didn’t give the chance of transition. “Jurgen Klopp didn’t like the menu.” United’s improved display still leaves their manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with plenty on his plate. But Mourinho focused more on Klopp’s potential problems. Ex-Chelsea chief Mourinho ribbed the Champions League winners by saying: “They missed quality to play against a team with a low block. “— The Sun.
