The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Arts Reporter MUSICIANS living outside the country can now promote their music in the country after a Harare-based company, Finto Marketing and Entertainment Consultancy, opened its doors to artistes living in the Diaspora. Founded by Fred Farai Nyakudanga, the company will also assist artistes living in the Diaspora with research on the local market. “I have realised that there are many Zimbabwean artistes living and producing arts products outside the country and want them sold locally. “Through Finto Marketing Company, we promote such products on the local market. There are a number of platforms that we use to make sure that their music is known to their home fans,” he said. Nyakudanga said his company has since engaged a number of musicians living outside the country, with South African-based singer Richard McDonald the latest on the list of artistes to enlist their services. “We have a vision of professionalising the entertainment industry in the country and assist organisations and individuals fulfil their entertainment mandate without any hassles. “It is also our mission to foster a win-win relationships in the arts industry,” he said. Boasting a rich entertainment background that saw him sitting on the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe advisory committee panel, Nyakudanga said his company wants to motivate musicians living in the Diaspora to bring their projects to the domestic market. Nyakudanga believes there are a lot of Zimbabwean musicians, who are producing quality music, which is not known locally. “Some musicians living abroad believe it is difficult to promote their music in Zimbabwe and it is here that we are coming in to assist them. “There are a lot of opportunities on the domestic market. I urge artistes in the Diaspora to invest on the local market, where they are guaranteed good returns,” he said.
