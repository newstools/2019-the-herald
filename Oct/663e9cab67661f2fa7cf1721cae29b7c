The Herald Cement company PPC and its chief financial officer have “mutually agreed to separate”, the company announced yesterday. PPC is listed on both the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. It also has operations in both countries and a few others across the continent. Tryphosa Ramano will step down on October 31 after eight years with PPC, the company said. She has agreed to take on a consultancy role with PPC to ensure continuity. Ronel van Dijk has been appointed as interim CFO and as an executive director. The Dutch cement executive Roland van Wijnen, who previously worked for Swiss multinational LafargeHolcim, took over as CEO of PPC at the start of this month. — Fin24.
