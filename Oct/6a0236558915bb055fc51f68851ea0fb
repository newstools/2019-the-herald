HERITAGE Senior School are confident of turning around their fortunes in cricket and rugby following the appointment of veteran administrator Crispen Mhike. He joined the school at the beginning of this year from Manicalandâ€™s Hillcrest College where he had served for close to two decades. Mhike is also a selector of the national schools rugby teams for the Craven Week tournament. The versatile Mhike will be supported by Gordon Pangeti. Heritage has a decent reputation in schools sports, particularly rugby. Last year they had Chima Nwadike and Gerald Pangeti selected for the Harare schools Under-13 squad. In the senior department, Jeffery-Antonio-Samuels and Alce Melo represented Zimbabwe Junior Rugby Sables at the 47th edition of the Craven Week tournament in South Africa.
