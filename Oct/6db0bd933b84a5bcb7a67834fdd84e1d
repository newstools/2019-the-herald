The Herald Victor Maphosa Herald Correspondent ZIMBABWEANS from all walks of life should register their protest against illegal sanctions imposed by the West on Friday, Citizens Against Economic Sanctions (CAES) executive director Mr Martin Zharare has said. SADC set October 25 as solidarity day in calling for the removal of sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by some Western nations. In Harare, thousands are expected to march to the National Sports Stadium where officials from Government, business, religious leaders, the academia, civic society and various other social groups will call for the unconditional removal of the sanctions. “CAES was formed by citizens from different angles who came together after realising the huge negative impact sanctions have on the economic, social and political affairs of this nation,” said Mr Zharare. Mr Zharare called on Western countries to unconditionally lift the sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe.
