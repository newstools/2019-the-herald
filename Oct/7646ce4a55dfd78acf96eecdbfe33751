The Herald KOBE. — Russia’s coach was full of praise for his players’ performance against Ireland at the Rugby World Cup yesterday, hailing it as a “big day” for Russian rugby despite their 35-0 defeat. “I’m absolutely delighted. It’s a big day for Russian rugby and we came through with five stars,” said Lyn Jones after his team held the much-fancied Irish for long periods of their Pool A clash. Jones said they had adjusted their defensive patterns to counter the Irish attacks, which he felt restricted the scoring of the favourites and forced them into kicking. “Our players stood up today . . . and we knocked the Irish boys back,” said Jones, a former Welsh international. Late tries from Andrew Conway and Garry Ringrose put gloss on the scoreline for Ireland, who made more handling errors than their coach Joe Schmidt would have liked, despite collecting the all-important bonus point. “Unfortunately we didn’t score any points . . . but Russia’s players gave everything they had and they were shattered at the end. And that’s all you can ask,” said Jones. — AFP.
