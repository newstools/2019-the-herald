The Herald South Africa’s rail and port parastatal Transnet yesterday launched the world’s longest train: it’s four-kilometres long with a record-breaking 375 wagons. The manganese train previously had 312 wagons and was already the longest in the world. But Transnet has increased the number of carriages, which will hike the manganese volume from 19 656 tons to 23 625 tons per train. It is designed to travel 861km between Sishen in the Northern Cape and Saldanha in the Western Cape. Transnet considered increasing the manganese’s rail capacity by upgrading the railway feeder lines and build new rolling stock, but then explored new technology to increase the train’s length instead. — Fin24.
