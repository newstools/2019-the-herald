The Herald Gold edged higher yesterday ahead of a crucial vote by British lawmakers on the Brexit withdrawal agreement, but buoyant Asian shares on progress in US-China trade talks limited gains. Spot gold inched 0,2 percent higher to $1 487,20 per ounce as of 0758 GMT. US gold futures also gained 0,2 percent to $1 490,30. In the latest on the Brexit proceedings, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s parliamentary battle starts again, when lawmakers will debate and vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the detailed legislation that puts his exit deal into British domestic law. Markets gained overnight on Wall Street with the benchmark S&P 500 stock index rising to within striking distance of a record high on reports of progress in US-China trade talks. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0,4 percent yesterday. — Reuters.
