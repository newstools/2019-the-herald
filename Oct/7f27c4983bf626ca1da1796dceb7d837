The Herald LONDON. – On-loan Arsenal midfielder Dani Ceballos has dismissed the possibility of extending his stay at the Emirates, saying he is determined to fight for a place at Spanish football giants Real Madrid next season. Ceballos joined Los Blancos on a six-year deal from Real Betis for 18 million euros in the summer of 2017, however, he struggled to tie down a regular spot in his first two seasons at the Bernabeu. The midfielder, who can play in a variety of positions, started just four games during his debut campaign in Madrid before earning a further 13 starting appearances in 2018-19. With his chances set to be limited again this season, Ceballos took it upon himself to secure a loan move away from the Spanish giants. It appears a warning from Spain boss Roberto Moreno played a big part in his decision to head out on-loan as he looks to ensure he is in the coach’s plans for Euro 2020. So far, his move to north London for the 2019-20 campaign has proven to be a successful one and he is earning plenty of admirers in England. -AFP.
