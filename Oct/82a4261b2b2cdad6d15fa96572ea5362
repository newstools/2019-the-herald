The Herald MANCHESTER. — Paul Pogba has been ruled out of Manchester United’s Europa League trip to AZ Alkmaar due to a recurrence of a foot injury he picked up in August. The Frenchman sustained the knock in the draw at Southampton at the start of the season and is yet to fully recover. He played 90 minutes in both the Carabao Cup win over Rochdale and the English Premier League draw with Arsenal in the past week, but will not travel to Holland for today’s game. A United statement said: “Following a specialist’s opinion, Paul Pogba requires a period of further rest & conservative treatment for the foot injury he sustained in the game against Southampton in August”. Pogba joins team-mates Anthony Martial, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka in missing the game due to various problems. United captain Ashley Young was also not in the squad announced by the club yesterday. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could face further injury woe with his squad set to play on an artificial pitch when they face AZ Alkmaar. United will be in action at the Kyocera Stadium in The Hague, which is 70 miles away from Alkmaar. The roof at AZ Alkmaar’s usual ground, the AFAS Stadium, collapsed last month, with the Eredivisie side having to play their home games elsewhere. — Mailonline.
