CHEGUTU Pirates coach, Richard Chunga, believes the return to their Pfupajena fortress will be a major boost to players and their  fans. The club have spent several months using Chakari as their home ground. But, they will be at Pfupajena today for the match against leaders Cranborne Bullets this afternoon. Pirates were sanctioned for their rowdy fans. “We all know how competitive the Northern Region Division One League is and we cannot allow a team to march towards the championship and even win with five games to play,’’ said Chunga. “We are going to use our home advantage, after several months playing away from home, and I think we need to bring our supporters something to cheer with a victory over Cranborne Bullets. “We know we have suspensions but we will give some of our youngsters an opportunity to prove themselves. “It is good to be back home and we look forward to a tough encounter.’’ Cranborne Bullets coach, Nesbert “Yabo’’ Saruchera, is on the cusp of taking his man into the Premiership. “My boys are now confident that they can achieve our set target, that is the championship,” said Saruchera.
