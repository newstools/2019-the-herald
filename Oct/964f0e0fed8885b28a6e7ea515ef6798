The Herald Zimbabwe’s energy regulator said  on Saturday the country’s fuel prices were unchanged for next week, much  to the relief of motorists used to weekly price increases. This is the second week in a roll that the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory  Authority (Zera) had kept fuel prices unchanged.  From August, Zera had been increasing fuel prices weekly in tandem with  the floating exchange rate, much to the chagrin of motorists.  But in spite of the price increase, the commodity has remained scarce,  with long winding queues a common feature at all fuel stations.  In a statement, Zera said fuel prices remained unchanged at $14,7 per  litre of petrol and $15,64 for diesel. “Please be advised that the fuel prices effective Monday October 21, 2019 are as follows: $15,64 per litre for diesel and $14,97 for petrol. Accordingly, prices have therefore not changed for both diesel and  blend. Operators may however sell at prices below the cap depending on  their trading advantages,” said Zera. — New Ziana.
