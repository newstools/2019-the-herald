The Herald Coca-Cola international sales and low-sugar offerings like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar drove brisk revenue growth in the third quarter. Shares jumped in early trading before paring much of the gain. The beverage giant said unit case volume grew by 2 percent, while net revenue expanded 8 percent to $9,5 billion. The key metric of organic revenue, which strips out some items like currency effects, jumped 5 percent — higher than analysts’ average estimate for a 4,1 percent gain. As US consumers increasingly opt for sparkling waters and plant-based milks over sugary beverages, Coke is betting big on offerings in these categories and reported double-digit volume growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in the US. The expansion overseas is working on a number of brands. The company reported “strong growth” in Minute Maid Pulpy in China and coffee and tea in Japan. – Reuters.
