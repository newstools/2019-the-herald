When the opportune time arose, we then did the projects.” Shumba said the songs were filled with hope and assurance, which are key subjects of the season. “We believe these songs will touch many souls because of the rich content they carry,” he said. “They are praise songs which are full of life, hope, encouragement and assurance.” Shumba said fans played a big role in encouraging them to work together and come up with something unique.
