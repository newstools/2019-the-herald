The Herald Zeco Holdings posted yet another loss of $0,886 million for the half-year to June 30, 2019 compared to a prior loss of $0,581 million. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange listing specialises in steel fabrication and installation as well as the manufacturing of plastic components and distribution of electric motors. Profit loss was greatly attributed to halted projects and the usual volatility of the operating environment that had become a reference across many trading results for the period. Infrastructure projects and construction materials constitute the company’s major revenue streams yet major projects were suspended. — Business Reporter.
