BENJAMIN LOCK completed a memorable weekend when he claimed his seventh International Tennis Federation World Tennis Tour singles title on Sunday. He beat Bulgaria’s Alexander Donski 6-7(5), 6-3, 7-6(3) in the SA Spring Open, in Johannesburg. It was a closely-contested match that saw Lock losing the first set 6-7 before he came back strongly to take the second set 6-3. The Zimbabwean player then claimed the third set 7-6(3) to win the title. On his way to the final, Lock had defeated fellow Zimbabwean and Davis Cup teammate Takanyi Garanganga, seeded third, 6-3, 7-6(4). It was double joy for Lock as on Saturday he had clinched the doubles title with his young brother Courtney. They dismissed Donski and David Pichler 6-3, 6-4. Saturday’s victory saw the Lock brothers taking their tally to 11 ITF World Tennis Tour doubles titles since winning their first title together three years ago. Their breakthrough win came in 2016, in Mozambique, and their partnership has continued to pay dividends over the last few years. They were home in June for the Old Mutual ITF World Tennis Tour M15, where they won their 10th title. Benjamin also won the singles at the same event. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe will get to know the identity of their opponents for the 2020 Davis Cup World Group II play-offs this week. The draw is scheduled for Thursday in London. Zimbabwe lost their Europe/Africa Group II tie against Romania 1-4 in April and they are now set to compete in the World Cup Group II play-offs under the new Davis Cup format.
