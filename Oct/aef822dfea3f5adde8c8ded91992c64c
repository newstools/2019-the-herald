The Herald LONDON. — How far will Manchester United sink? Just two points above the relegation places, the one-time powerhouses of English football are without an away win since March and are enduring their worst start to a league season for 30 years. Old Trafford has witnessed a decline in fortunes since Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013. Under Ferguson, United finished in the top three every year from 1992 until 2013, winning 13 league titles. In the six seasons since, the Red Devils have finished in the top four just twice. But while they kept their heads above water in the immediate aftermath of the Scot’s departure, winning a handful of cups and finishing second under Jose Mourinho, they are now in the middle of a full-blown crisis under beleaguered boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Mourinho, speaking a few weeks after his rancorous departure from Old Trafford last year, spoke about how taking the club to second in the table in 2017/18 was one of his best achievements. Eyebrows were raised as Solskjaer oversaw a dramatic turnaround in fortunes during his caretaker spell in charge, but the wheels started to come off towards the end of last season. United’s 1-0 defeat at Newcastle on Sunday left them languishing in 12th spot in the Premier League — an incredible 15 points behind leaders Liverpool after just eight games. — AFP.
