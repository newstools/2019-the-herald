The Herald LONDON. – The Nike Oregon Project has been closed down in the wake of head coach Alberto Salazar being banned for four years after being found guilty of doping violations. In a statement, a Nike spokesperson said the Salazar situation had become “an unfair burden” on NOP athletes. The NOP’s website and social media channels have been taken down. Nike has always tried to put the athlete and their needs at the front of all of our decisions,” Nike added. “This situation including uninformed innuendo and unsubstantiated assertions has become an unfair burden for current OP athletes. That is exactly counter to the purpose of the team. “We have therefore made the decision to wind down the Oregon Project to allow the athletes to focus on their training and competition needs. We will help all of our athletes in this transition as they choose the coaching set up that is right for them.” – BBC Sport.
