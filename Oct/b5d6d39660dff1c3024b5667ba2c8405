The Herald The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has faulted the structure of the country’s economy for delivering economic growth without jobs and a rise in income. CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge on Monday said households have not felt the growth in the gross domestic product (GDP).
He reckoned that increased infrastructure spending has not spread wealth among working Kenyans. Dr Njoroge’s comments come at a time when corporate Kenya has witnessed reduced profitability that has ushered in job cuts, a freeze in hiring and near-stagnant wages in the race to protect profit margins amid a 5,6 percent economic growth in the second quarter to June. The number of formal jobs generated by the economy fell to a six-year low in 2018, worsening the plight of school leavers in the year that the Jubilee administration recorded its best economic performance with growth at 6,3 percent. — Daily Nation.
