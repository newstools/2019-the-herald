FORMER Zimbabwe Handball Federation president, Amon Madzvamuse, has bounced back into mainstream sports administration in charge of cestoball. It’s a sport which started in Argentina in 1897. It has similarities with netball and handball. The sport is expected to be run by the newly-formed Zimbabwe Cestoball Association led by Madzvamuse. Madzvamuse will be deputised by Annahmariah Jirimwe. Yvette Ndlovu will be the secretary-general and Lydia Chitambo comes in as the referees’ chairperson. And they are in the process of registering the association with the Sports Commission. Ndlovu said they have been doing the groundwork for the introduction of the sport since late last year and we were working with schools in Masvingo, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, Mashonaland Central , Midlands, Manicaland and Harare. They submitted their constitution to the Sports Commission last month for registration. “We started it last year, sometime in November, that’s when the International Cestoball Federation contacted some of the members at ZICA. “We held our fist general meeting as ZICA which led to a draft of a constitution which I personally submitted to the Sports Commission. “So, as we speak, we are waiting for the Sports Commission’s response. We first had the introduction of the sport, this has been ongoing since last year to date. “But then we had to have the official meeting and make sure everything is in place,” said Ndlovu.
