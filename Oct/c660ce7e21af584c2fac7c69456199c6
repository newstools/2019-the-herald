The Herald Gold prices were little changed yesterday, hovering around $1 490 an ounce as progress in China-US trade talks sent equities soaring, while anticipation ahead of major central bank meetings in the week provided some support. Spot gold was trading at $1 493,11 per ounce at 0938 GMT, after shedding nearly 1 percent in the previous session. US gold futures were flat at $1 495,70 an ounce. US President Donald Trump said on Monday he expected to sign a significant part of the trade deal with China ahead of schedule. The possibility of an extension on tariff suspensions on $34 billion of Chinese goods also fuelled optimism. Wall Street jumped to an all-time peak after the statements on Monday, while Asian shares scaled a three-month high in early trade yesterday. “There is a broad risk-on sentiment, with US equities hitting a fresh record high. The trade talks are highly unpredictable . . . It has disappointed investors many times in the past and may repeat again,” said Margaret Yang Yan, a market analyst at CMC Markets. — Reuters.
