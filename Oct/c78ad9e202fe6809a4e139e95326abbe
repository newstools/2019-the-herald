The Herald ECOSURE has launched a transport service meant to give its policy holders convenience of access to free transport during the bereavement. The new package will be offered by EcoSure in partnership with Vaya, and will be known as the EcoSure Vaya Add On package. Announcing the launch in Harare Wednesday, Cassava Smartech chief executive Eddie Chibi said the package was aimed at easing the burden of transport for policy holders. “In times of bereavement, one needs transport to run around and plan the funeral programme. Vehicles such as buses are also required to ferry mourners. We are introducing affordable transport packages that will ease this burden for our clients,” he said. — Business Reporter.
