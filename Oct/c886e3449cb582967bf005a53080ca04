The Herald Joseph Madzimure Senior Reporter MORE than 600 delegates drawn from Zanu-PF’s eight provinces arrived yesterday to supervise the party’s District Coordinating Committee (DCC) elections for Harare on Saturday. The delegates were drawn from Masvingo, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland West, Manicaland, Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South and Midlands. They will be led by provincial chairpersons who will subsequently report to the team of five Politburo members led by national chairperson Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri that is overseeing the re-establishment of a District Co-ordinating Committees (DCC). The other Politburo members are Secretary for Administration Dr Obert Mpofu, Political Commissar Cde Victor Matemadanda, secretary for Finance and Economic Development Cde Patrick Chinamasa and secretary for Security Cde Lovemore Matuke. The party’s DCCs were disbanded in 2012 after it was felt they had been hijacked by elements that wanted to manipulate party structures to foment factionalism and disharmony in the party. Zanu-PF National Political Commissar Cde Victor Matemadanda said the delegates will be briefed on the tasks today. “We want to have a clean voting exercise to ensure the party come up with proper structures, which will be used in the formation of other structures such as cells, wards, branches and provincial structures,” he said. In addition, Cde Matemadanda said the increase in the numbers of supervisors was meant to maintain the integrity of the process. “It is now all systems go as the party is ready to conduct successful DCC elections. The printing of ballot papers is currently underway and is almost through. We expect the printing of ballots to be through by the end of the day (yesterday).” The reintroduction of DCCs is the first step towards the re-structuring of the party as Zanu-PF prepares for the 2023 harmonised elections. After Harare, the DCC elections will move to Bulawayo and spread to all the other provinces.
