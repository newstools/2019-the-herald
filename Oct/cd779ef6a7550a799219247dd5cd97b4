The Herald Old Mutual has argued in court papers that it is not in contempt of court for refusing to let its former CEO Peter Moyo return to work, as the increasing convoluted legal struggle between the insurance giant and Moyo enters its fourth month. In an answering affidavit filed with the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Tuesday, Old Mutual says its relationship with Moyo has been “completely destroyed”. The fact that Moyo has accused the company’s directors of being delinquent means there is no chance of a “future successful relationship”. The papers were filed in response to an earlier ruling that Moyo could introduce further evidence in his contempt of court application against the firm and its directors for not allowing him to resume his duties.  —Reuters.
