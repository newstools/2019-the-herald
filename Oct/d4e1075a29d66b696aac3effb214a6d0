MBIRA artiste Ranson “Mazarura” Madzamba, has finished recording his debut six-track album “Ndozvireva” set for release within two months. Mazarura, as Madzamba prefers to be called in the music industry, said he was putting logistics in place for the album launch scheduled for a yet-to-be-announced venue in the capital. “I am done recording my debut album with producer Maselo putting some final touches on some of the tracks,” he said. “As a traditionalist, I have included Jiti beats in some of the tracks fused with mbira. “It is only a matter of time, but very soon my fans around the country will be dancing to my new music. I have managed to collaborate with one of the most talented musicians in the country, who will feature on the video of the song. “The album will be accompanied by two videos that will be released at the launch,” he said. Mazarura said his music was inspired by the late music icon Oliver Mtukudzi and Chimurenga singer Thomas Mapfumo. “Traditional music is the only genre that can sell out there. People out there have fallen in love with the mbira instrument and they, indeed, identify it with being Zimbabwean. “It is the only way to go if one wants to go international, especially when coming from Zimbabwe and Africa in general,” he said. Mazarura urged other upcoming artistes to embrace local music. “I enjoy playing mbira music and I would want to take my Afro-fusion tunes to the world. “So far, I have managed to release two singles “Ndozvireva” and “Huya Tigare”.
