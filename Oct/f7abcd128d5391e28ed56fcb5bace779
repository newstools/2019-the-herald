The Herald BIRMINGHAM. — Aston Villa fans on Twitter are drooling over Marvelous Nakamba’s performance on Saturday. Dean Smith’s side were held to a 2-2 draw with Burnley at Villa Park, having taken the lead on two occasions. It was a bitterly disappointing day for Aston Villa, who have lost eight points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, but there were some positives. John McGinn enhanced his reputation with a third goal of the season, Matt Targett made his Premier League debut and a certain Marvelous Nakamba showed English football what he could do. The Zimbabwe international is looking like an exceptional find by Smith, who spent only £11 million on taking him to the West Midlands. He posted another accomplished, tidy performance in midfield and one that should’ve been for a winning team. In possession and out of it, Nakamba looks the real deal. The Zimbabwean was a pivotal figure in Dean Smith’s side with the midfielder consistently pressuring Burnley in possession and for the majority of the time successfully intercepting the ball. Nakamba has completely re-energised the midfield with his tenacity and artfulness impressing the Villa faithful and if he continues to make an impression on a consistent basis then he could become one of the most important players in the squad. — sb.nation/HITC.
