The Herald Veronica Gwaze in BULAWAYO AFTER a heart-breaking 2-3 defeat to rivals University of Zimbabwe Wolves in a national league volleyball match at White City stadium yesterday, Harare City feel they now have a score to settle with their opponents. The match stretched into the fourth set to make a decision and Harare City gaffer Itsanang Abu-Basutu felt his side played a spectacular game despite falling in the end. “We have been preparing for the national league but, specifically, for this encounter because we knew this is always the highlight of the league or tournament in the Zimbabwe. “We need to make sure we go back and re-do our maths because we still have to face them again at the nationals. “Despite losing, which obviously comes as a disappointment, the boys did very well.’’ Seeking to bolster their squad Harare City had to sign on power heaters Keith Machakaire from UZ Wolves and Charles Nyamaswe from Support Unity and Terrence Chapingidza from UZ Wolves. Chapingidza, however, was not in action due to a hamstring injury. Meanwhile, in another match, Harare City women side walloped Support Unity 3-1.
