THE Zimbabwe Chinese Table Tennis Association chairperson, Li Ping Wang, said the tournament was a great success and believes it helped to boost relations between the two countries. The two-day event was held at the Harare international School. The Zimbabwe men got the better of their Chinese opponents while the Chinese women won their showdown against the hosts. “We thank everyone who made it possible we are grateful to all those whose efforts enabled us to have a successful tournament,’’ said Wang. “We are hopeful that next year it will be bigger and better, there was intense competition and the sport is getting popular with the locals, which is good. “China is a powerhouse in the world of table tennis and has dominated on the world stage and we decided to help develop the sport here in Zimbabwe two years ago through the Ambassador’s Cup and each year it is growing, which is good. “I am happy that there is a growing interest in the sport in Zimbabwe and the desire to emulate China, which has players who come tops in international events.’’ The tournament saw nine men and seven women taking on each other in the annual competition. The Chinese Ambassador’s Cup was sponsored by local companies and Chinese business communities in Zimbabwe. It is expected to further strengthen the friendship and promote bilateral relations between the two countries. The tournament was hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe and co-organised by the Zimbabwe Chinese Table Tennis Association and the Zimbabwe Table Tennis Union.
