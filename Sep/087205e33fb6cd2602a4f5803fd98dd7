The Herald Tendai Rupapa Senior Reporter Two suspected fraudsters who allegedly masqueraded as military intelligence officers before attempting to extort US$40 000 from Prophetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries founder, Walter Magaya, were yesterday remanded in custody to today for bail ruling. It is alleged that Takesure Marisa (50), who is an ex-soldier and a woman, Petners Zvabva (45), demanded “protection fees”. Zvabva introduced herself as Lieutenant-Colonel Zvobgo while Marisa identified himself as Major-General Dube. The pair allegedly misrepresented that the money was wanted by their superiors who had powers to protect or plot Prophet Magaya’s downfall. Zvabva and Marisa denied extortion and impersonation charges when they appeared before magistrate Mrs Vongai Muchuchuti-Guwuriro. Though Marisa denied the charges, he further told the court that he had only been hired. They are both represented by Harare lawyer Mr Charles Warara. Prosecutor Mrs Idah Maromo opposed bail on the basis that there was overwhelming evidence against the pair considering that Zvabva was caught red-handed following a trap.
