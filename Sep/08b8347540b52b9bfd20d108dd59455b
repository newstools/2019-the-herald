The Herald PARIS. — Belgium and the Netherlands both cruised to 4-0 wins over Scotland and Estonia, respectively, in Euro 2020 football qualifying on Monday night, while Germany claimed a crucial victory over Northern Ireland in their bid to qualify for next year’s finals. Roberto Martinez’s Belgium, the world-number-one ranked side, were not at their best but still swatted aside a poor Scotland outfit at Hampden Park to make it six wins from as many matches in Group I. Inter Milan striker Romelu Lukaku gave the visitors the lead in Glasgow in only the ninth minute with his Belgian record-extending 49th international goal. Defenders Thomas Vermaelen and Toby Alderweireld ended the game as a contest with less than 32 minutes on the clock. Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who had assisted each of the first three goals, completed the scoring himself with eight minutes remaining. — AFP.
