The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool recovered from a shock Newcastle opener to open up a five-point lead at the top of the English Premier League football table with a 3-1 win at Anfield, as Tottenham and Chelsea bounced back to form with big wins on Saturday. Champions Manchester City failed to close the gap at the top to two points after they were stunned 3-2 by Norwich. Tammy Abraham’s sensational form continued as the English forward scored a hat-trick as Chelsea romped to a 5-2 win at Wolves. Spurs were 4-0 up by half-time against Crystal Palace to record just their second win of the season as Son Heung-min scored twice, while Erik Lamela and an own goal from Patrick van Aanholt rounded off the scoring on a miserable day for the Eagles. An injury-hit Manchester United coped without Paul Pogba to inflict Leicester’s first defeat of the season as Marcus Rashford scored the only goal from the penalty spot in a 1-0 win at Old Trafford. — AFP.
