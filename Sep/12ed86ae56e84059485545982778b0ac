HERENTALS’ survival bid has received a big boost with the return of key players from injury ahead of their rescheduled Premiership tie against Chicken Inn at Luveve this afternoon. Coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva hasn’t had a full complement of his squad since the beginning of the season. Herentals have 23 points from 22 matches and are deep in the relegation mire ahead of this tie. The team has been without impressive midfielder, Kelvin Bingala, as well as defenders, Carlos Mavhurume, and Blessing Maunganidze in their recent games. Striker Archmore Majarira has also been struggling for form, having recently returned from a knee strain. Captain Blessing Majarira has also been on and off the treatment table. “We are approaching this match with some sense of caution. We cannot concede in every match. “We cannot win games when we always concede. This is one area we have been working on and we hope to see some improvements against Chicken Inn,” said Mutiwekuziva. He predicted a tough tie against a Chicken Inn side who will shoot top of the standings with a win this afternoon. Chicken Inn are on 38 points and will leapfrog leaders CAPS United on goal difference if they bag the maximum points this afternoon. “Chicken Inn are gunning for the championship and there is no doubting their pedigree,’’ said Mutiwekuziva. “They are one of the best teams around. We are obviously expecting a tough ride at their own backyard. “But, we are in a precarious situation which calls for us to be extremely disciplined. This is no time to give opponents too much respect. Every point now counts.” Fixtures Today: Chicken Inn v Herentals (Luveve) Bulawayo Chiefs v Highlanders (B/F)
