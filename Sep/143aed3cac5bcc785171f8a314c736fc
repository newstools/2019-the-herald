The Herald LONDON. — Joseph Parker’s manager “agrees” with Derek Chisora’s press conference rant, but says the New Zealander does not have any “ego issues” ahead of their heavyweight boxing fight. Zimbabwe-born British boxer Chisora demanded to know why his fight with Parker was not the main event, launching into an expletive-laden tirade at the first press conference on Monday for a bumper O2 bill, which is topped by Regis Prograis against Josh Taylor on October 26. Prograis faces Scotland’s Taylor in the World Boxing Super Series final, with two world super-lightweight titles at stake, but Higgins believes Parker’s crucial clash with Chisora will also capture the attention of fight fans next month. “Yeah I agree,” Higgins told Sky Sports. “Parker-Chisora or Chisora-Parker as the Brits like to call it is a bigger attraction commercially, in terms of tickets sold at The O2 and viewing figures. It depends on how you are making the decision. “Technically it (Prograis vs Taylor) is more elite in terms of titles, but in terms of fan favourites and exciting boxing matches, Parker-Chisora is the bigger event, so I agree with Chisora. “That being said, our side don’t really care as much. Joseph has never been one to have ego issues, or worry about stuff like that. He knows what the job is and it will be to punch Chisora in the face, and shut him up.” Chisora has parted company with trainer David Coldwell, who guided the 35-year-old to an explosive knockout win over Artur Szpilka in his last fight. The Rotherham-based coach confirmed on social media that he could not split his time between his other fighters and travelling to London for Chisora’s preparations. Higgins said: “It’s a sign of problems in the camp and close to the fight. To lose his trainer this far out, and a trainer that appeared to be a good team, you’ve got to ask why? “Our team is unified, professional and on the home track without any problems.”— Sky Sports.
