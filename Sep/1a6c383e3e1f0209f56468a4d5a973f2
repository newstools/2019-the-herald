TONGOONA CHARAMBA was the best-placed Zimbabwean after the opening round of the Castle Lite Uganda Open which teed off at the Lake Victoria Serena Golf Resort and Spa in Kampala, Uganda, on Wednesday.
The Chapman professional golfer was second behind South Africa’s Irvin Mazibuko who carded a four-under 68 during the opening round. Charamba shares second slot with Kenya’s Justus Madoya on two-under-70.
The tournament has a US$50 000 kitty.
Also in contention is another Zimbabwean, Robson Chinhoi, who is lying fourth at one-under-71.
Zambian Madalitso Muthiya is level par 72 in fifth place.
Another Zimbabwean, Visitor Mapwanya, is in sixth place. The tournament has seen a high number of Zimbabweans professionals with eight taking part.
Local professional golfers, who are lacking game time locally, have since decided to take part in other African Open tournaments, particularly in East, Central and West African countries.
