RUGBY referee Precious Pazani’s profile continues to rise as she is set to become the first female Zimbabwean to officiate a World Rugby women’s Test match today. Pazani will be in charge of today’s game between South Africa and Spain in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. “It means I have just been recognised and given a great opportunity and that’s very important. ‘’It’s my first appointment but not my first rugby game, it will be different from the usual men’s games I am used to but rugby is rugby at the end of the day. “I believe there are plenty of more opportunities for me in the future. I just have to keep working hard,” said Pazani.  Posting on their Facebook page, Zimbabwe Rugby Referees Society said Pazani becomes the first local female referee to officiate a World Rugby-sanctioned women’s Test match. “History has been made and records have been broken by Zimbabwe’s number one referee Precious Pazani as she is set to be the first female Zimbabwean referee to officiate a World Rugby appointed women’s Test match between South Africa vs Spain in Port Elizabeth, South Africa tomorrow (today), the 21st of September. “She was recently part of a World Rugby course in South Africa with her being Africa’s only representative,” read part of the post.
