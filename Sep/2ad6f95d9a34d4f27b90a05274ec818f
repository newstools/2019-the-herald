The Herald The Gweru City Council  has identified a site to establish a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the  high density suburb of Mkoba where it plans to construct both heavy and  light industries. The local authority has since submitted the proposed model to the  Government for consideration. The move follows the call by the Government for cities and towns to  identify SEZs in their areas. A Special Economic Zone is an area in a country that is subject to  unique economic regulations that differ from other areas in the same country as its regulations tend to be conducive to attracting foreign  direct investment (FDI). City planner Mr Peter Mamhute, told a recent Midlands special economic  zones meeting that council had identified a site in Mkoba 8 popularly  known as the MASO area along Hamutyinei road where it would build heavy  and light industries. Mr Mamhute said development of the SEZ, to be named Industrial Park, would  not be done by the city council alone but would be with private partners  to be identified. — New Ziana.
