THE newly-established Ruwa Country Club clubhouse was gutted by fire, leaving a trail of destruction. National Police spokesperson Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident and said they were still investigating the cause of the fire. “We can confirm that there was fire breakout at Ruwa Country Club and we are still investigating the cause. “We are not yet aware of the value of the destroyed property, but no one was injured,” said Nyathi. Ruwa was recently transformed into a golf resort and residential estate and the development is currently underway. They completed a brand new 18-hole championship golf course. The 75-year-old clubhouse underwent extensive refurbishment which was “designed to retain its old charm whilst at the same time delivering modern conveniences.’’ Situated east of Harare, approximately 26 kilometres along Mutare Road, the up-market golf resort is Zimbabwe’s second such development after Borrowdale Brooke. The estate sits on 144 hectares (360 acres) and was created by consolidating two adjoining properties, one of which housed the original Ruwa Golf and Country club. The new property has been sub-divided to create a “recreational area” comprising the golf course, hotel, conference centre and other facilities. The remainder is divided into 168 residential stands of approximately 2 000 square metres each.
