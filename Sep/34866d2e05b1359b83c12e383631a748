The Herald Sikhumbuzo Moyo in BEIRA, Mozambique FC Platinum believe they have what it takes to weather the storm here this afternoon when they take on Clube Ferroviario da Beira in a CAF Champions League match. The Zimbabwean champions take a 1-0 lead from the first leg. “We are here for a result, an outcome that will take us to the group stage of the tournament, but we are aware that we are not playing a light side,’’ said coach Lizwe Sweswe. It’s going to be a very difficult game, especially judging by the kind of competition that UD Songo gave us back home. “We just have to forget about that result (first leg), this is a new game altogether that needs us to grind a result.’’ Speaking at the same Press conference, midfielder-turned-central defender Kelvin Madzongwe said they had the quality to deal with the opposition. “We are fully focused and we don’t want to talk about the first leg result. With the quality of players we have in our team, I am sure we will accomplish our mission,” said Madzongwe. “For games of this magnitude, one needs no other motivation other than the fact that it’s the Champions League.”
