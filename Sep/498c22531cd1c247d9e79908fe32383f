The Herald Gold dropped to a near one-month low yesterday to hold below the key $1,500 pivot, hit by a stronger dollar and an improved appetite for riskier assets supported by hopes of global economic stimulus. Spot gold was down 0,3 percent at $1,494.04 per ounce as of 1126 GMT. “More recently, we’ve had quite a broad improvement in risk appetite – the US stock markets are now little shy away from record highs — that is taking some of the edge off gold,” OANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam said.
