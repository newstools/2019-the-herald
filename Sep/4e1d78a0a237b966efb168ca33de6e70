YOUNG Warriors coach, Tonderai Ndiraya, says he has had a tough time psyching his distraught troops after their meltdown in South Africa. The Zimbabweans crashed to a 0-5 defeat at the hands of their South African counterparts in a AFCON Under-23 qualifier. The reverse fixture is set for Barbourfields this afternoon at 3pm. “It’s been psychologically difficult for the boys in the past few days after that heavy defeat in South Africa,’’ said Ndiraya. “They lost concentration in critical moments of the game. “We have had three sessions since our return from South Africa and that has helped restore some measure of confidence in the team. “The progress should help in our fight to try and turn around the scoreline. It will be difficult but it can be done. This is football. It’s unpredictable.’’ The gaffer has sought to add some steel in the squad by calling three more players ahead of this crunch tie. He has added Harare City midfielder, Tatenda Tumba, Highlanders defender Andrew Mbeba and Mandlenkosi Mlilo of Ngezi Platinum to strengthen the team. “We have called in Andrew (Mbeba), Mandlenkosi (Mlilo) and Tatenda (Tumba) to add depth to the team. “We definitely need a massive result to be able to qualify for the Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations. “Given that we lost by a huge scoreline, we need to go all out to attack. We need to harvest goals and I am confident the boys have what it takes to overturn that first-leg result. “But, look, it is going to be very tough. It is quite an awkward situation which we find ourselves in.”
