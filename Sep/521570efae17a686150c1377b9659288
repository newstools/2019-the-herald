The Herald DHAKA. — Zimbabwean cricketer Ryan Burl has revealed that the country’s suspension from the ICC has been a tough pill to swallow for the players, mainly due to the fact that they missed out on qualification for the 2020 T20 World Cup. He also heaped praise on the “inspirational” Hamilton Masakadza. Two months ago, world cricket came to a standstill after news broke out that Zimbabwe were suspended by the International Cricket Council. This, in turn, meant that the players had to face harrowing consequences, that of missing out on international cricket and, more importantly, an opportunity to qualify for the 2020 T20 World Cup. The team was subsequently replaced by Namibia in WT20 Qualifiers and all the players could do was stand back and watch in horror as the events unfolded. Several cricketers, including the likes of Brendan Taylor and Sikandar Raza, voiced their opinion against ICC’s decision, but unfortunately, to no avail. Now, batsman Ryan Burl, who starred in the first match of the ongoing T20I tri-series by blasting a 32-ball 57 against Bangladesh, has revealed that it was a dark time for Zimbabwe cricket when the controversy unravelled. And, that the players found it difficult to cope up with the news. He also expressed his sympathy for the senior members of the team, who now arguably have lost out on one final opportunity to represent their country on a world stage. “For everyone involved in the cricketing community in Zimbabwe it’s been a tough pill to swallow not qualifying for the World Cup,” Burl told SportsCafe. “Obviously, for a few guys it would have been their last opportunity to play in a World Cup, and I feel they have probably hurt the most.’’ — Sportscafe
