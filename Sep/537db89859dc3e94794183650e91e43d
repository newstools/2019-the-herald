The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo It’s Jacaranda time! Yes, they are continuing to blossom and definitely you know what that means, exam time. Good luck to the sitting candidates. But exam time does not mean we should forget about fashion trends. So this week was a hullabaloo! First up, was the famous summer shirt, which again has become an instant hit for some reasons that it was worn by sungura ace Alick Macheso and Zimdancehall sensation Freeman. When it comes to looking for men’s summer shirts, let’s face it – we’ve got the shorter end of the stick in comparison to the fairer sex. While the ladies have a plethora of options from summer dresses to silky skirts, we’re left with a selection of trousers and some simple shirt options. Freeman and Alick Macheso song, “Ngaibake” became a hit overnight, on the fashion side, many were shocked to see Macheso rocking the yellow floral summer-shirt. This is the same shirt we saw musician Seh Calaz wearing too some months ago and it’s not even news by the way as some would want to think off. That is again the same shirt we have seen some of the hip-hop stars wearing. Close sources have revealed that the shirt is going for R150 in South Africa and some local fashionistas who saw the opportunity are already buying in bulk and selling it at US$30. I was shocked when I  visited the Zimpost complex where most youths are doing business, and bumped into controversial rapper and host DJ Towers – actually he was wearing the most talked about shirt. Kudos to Macheso and Freeman for not bringing back the style but reminding us that it is summer and it’s a must have for every guy. Remember those shirts were trendy in the late 90s, I hope my uncle still has his. The golden tip when wearing a summer shirt is that you need to understand that summer shirts are an essential item in any man’s wardrobe. <img class="size-full wp-image-451349" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Ngaibake1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Ngaibake1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Ngaibake1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Towers wearing “Ngaibake” shirt They are the typical choice for businessmen or those looking for a smarter style, but they can also be worn in a more casual setting. It can be hard to see the difference between a summer shirt and a casual shirt as nowadays, the lines between them are more blurred. But there are a few things to look for when identifying a typical summer shirt: Colour: The classic summer shirts were always white long back but more recently a wider range has become available. In fact, now it has to be colourful, floral or any design. Material: Summer shirts will always be made from the best materials as they are known for their quality and fit. This means they can be quite expensive. Buttons: You can button your shirt all the way up for a smart look, if you want, or to give a sex appeal just pin up two buttons. For smart casual you can get away with undoing only your top button. And for the more casual style, simply undo a few more buttons. But don’t go over the top, you don’t need your whole chest on display. So make your choice and stick to it. Then the past two days, God shook his thermostat and boom, the temperatures dropped. It was cold in summer and telling those outside Zimbabwe, one could not believe it. Just a second, we witnessed those boho shoes, padded jackets, overcoats and fur taking over the sun. This proved that we are always ready in our wardrobe but we need to understand how we update your summer wardrobe. However, the world is divided into two types of consumer; those who embrace fashion and those who shop out of necessity, only buying something when an item absolutely needs to be replaced or as a reaction to changes in environment. Well, most middle-aged men, myself included, fall into the latter category. I have never queued outside an Apple Store to be one of the first to get my hands on the latest gadget, and have only felt the need to buy a new winter coat when it actually gets cold or a pair of shorts when temperatures climb into the 30s. I like it when fashion writer Ruairidh Pritchard, states that when it comes to dressing well, there are aspects of a man’s wardrobe that often fall foul of the basics ABCs of maintenance and care, and shoes are at the top of the list. While you may have a perfectly crisp suit, that can mean nothing if you’re sporting a scruffy pair of Oxfords that haven’t seen a proper polish for a while. Here is a quick guide on how to maintain your shoes; Buy, and use, a shoe tree If you don’t already own a shoe tree – the time to invest in one, or a few, is now. Designed to keep the shape of a shoe when not being worn, shoe trees generally come in three variations; sprung, without a full heal, full, with a full heal, and lasted, which are designed specifically for the last (or shape) of the specific shoe it is intended for. The benefit of using a shoe tree is that it absorbs moisture and reduces creasing. Use high quality care products It should go without saying, but shoe care products aren’t all born equal. There’s no point in investing in a good quality leather shoe if you aren’t willing to invest in some equally good leather care products, only use the highest quality wax polish to care for the highest quality leathers. And as for a suitable leather care product, keep it as natural as possible. “Use soft horse hair brushes and use separate brushes for the removal of dust and dirty, adding and buffing the polish”, said Thembinkosi Matongo – a cobbler. Remember the secret is in the leather, give it a nice finish rub.
