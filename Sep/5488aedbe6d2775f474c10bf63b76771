YADAH coach Genesis Mangombe says their battle against Bulawayo Chiefs is a six-pointer which they need to win in their battle to avoid the chop. The two sides clash at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. Bulawayo Chiefs are a point and place above Yadah. “It’s a game of football, you know when you are playing a team in the relegation zone, it’s quite a difficult game altogether,” said Mangombe. You need to be cautious and at the same time you will also need to attack. “This is definitely one of the toughest matches we have to play this season. Both teams will be out to win this one, given the positions they find themselves on the log. “Both teams will also try by all means, not to concede. It’s going to be a bruising battle. A tough one for both teams. But, as Yadah, we have prepared very well and we will be firing from all angles.  We have done everything to prepare for this encounter.’’ Mangombe has a full complement of his squad to choose his troops from. “We have no injury worries and better still we are welcoming back Leroy (Mavhunga), who has been with the national team and that gives us some depth going forward.”
