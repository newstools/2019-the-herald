CAPS United officials have a meeting with Italian coach Roberto Landi this week as they continue to search for a substantive gaffer to guide the club following the departure of Lloyd Chitembwe. The 63-year-old arrived in the country on Monday and watched the Warriors’ 2022 World Cup qualifier against Somalia at the National Sports Stadium the following day.
Earlier reports had suggested Roberto was being recruited for the Warriors’ job. However, it has emerged the Italian is eyeing to becoming the Green Machine head coach, possibly from the start of the new season next year. Landi has been in the coaching trenches since 1990 and served as the goalkeepers’ coach for the American national football team at the 1990 World Cup finals. He coached the youth teams of Georgia, Qatar and Lithuania and coached in Bulgaria and Hungary.
His experience with African football came when he coached Liberia from January 2011 before he was sacked on June 18 the following year after six wins, five draws and seven defeats. The Green Machine’s attempts to lure Landi also comes at a time their camp has been shaken after players boycotted training yesterday to press for the payment of their dues.
