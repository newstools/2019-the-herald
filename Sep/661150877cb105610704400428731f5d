FC PLATINUM will be hoping to reclaim top spot in the Castle Lager Premiership race when they host Mushowani in a re-arranged league tie at Mandava this afternoon. The Zvishavane side are in third place on the table and will meet a Mushowani Stars punching above their weight. The champions have 39 points, two shy of the log leaders CAPS United. A win today would hand them back control of the race, while Mushowani are battling to steer away from the relegation zone. However, FC Platinum coach Lizwe Sweswe said they were not underrating their opponents. Mushowani Stars might be the underdogs in this match, and have many issues clouding their focus, including financial challenges, but they have the capacity to throw a devastating punch. They booked a place in the Chibuku Super Cup first round by defeating Bulawayo Chiefs at the same venue a fortnight ago. “Mushowani are playing very well, and taking into consideration that they are fighting relegation, it is going to be a tough game,’’ said Sweswe. “But, the guys have been doing well at training, they have been working very hard to make sure we come up with a positive result. “We are not under any pressure, and we are taking each game as it comes. Looking at the log standings, we need to win our home games to keep our campaign alive.’’ Fixtures
