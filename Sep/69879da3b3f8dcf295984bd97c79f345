The Herald LONDON. — Frank Lampard refused to single out individuals for blame after his Chelsea side let a two-goal lead slip to be held 2-2 by Sheffield United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. But the former England and Chelsea midfielder was unsparing in his criticism of social media platforms on which his defender Kurt Zouma was the victim of racist abuse after his late own goal cost Chelsea two points. “We have to look at social media and the platforms and give them some accountability, to actually have people registered who can be chased down for it,” Lampard said. “I think it’s simple. Until we get to that, however, horrible the conversation is, we are all going to get tired talking about it because if there’s no culpability then anyone can say anything to anyone. “I don’t care if it’s racism, it could be homophobia, sexism — if we allow it then it’s out there and it has to be dealt with. “I think we have plans (to meet companies). Everyone knows where we want to go with it and not just with our players, any player.” Lampard is still waiting for his first win at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea manager after his side blew a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 at home to Sheffield United on Saturday. Lampard’s faith in Tammy Abraham was again rewarded as his two opportunist strikes had Chelsea well on course for the three points at half-time. — AFP.
