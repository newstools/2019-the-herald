The Herald KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp says he is not happy Khama Billiat took a huge gamble to serve his country, while recovering from injury, in the World Cup qualifiers this week. The Zimbabwean forward has featured in just two appearances for the Amakhosi, since the start of the season, after being side-lined with a knee injury after his return from the AFCON finals. Billiat was not considered for the first leg of the World Cup qualifier against Somalia in Djibouti, which the Warriors lost 0-1, but returned to score the winning goal in the reverse fixture on Tuesday. “You should talk to the player. I actually have my own idea in this direction and, the player made his decision and that’s it,” said Middendorp at the PSL offices yesterday. “It’s not about being impressed (with his performance). We were not able as the club to use the player for full 90 minutes at all until now. “Now, running into (such a game) — I understand — serving his country and so on, that is why I’m saying ask the player, how is he capable three days later to do something responsible?” — Sports Reporter/Kick-Off
