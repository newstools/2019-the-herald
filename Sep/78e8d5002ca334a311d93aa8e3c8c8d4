Weather experts had met in Harare for the National Outlook Climate Forum (Narcof) workshop with the Meteorological Services Department and were expected to release the 2019/20 national rainfall forecast on Wednesday this week. The 2019/20 Narcof comes after SADC member states met last week in Angola for the 2019/20 seasonal climate outlook for the region. The seasonal rainfall forecast informs the nation about the rainfall expected in different agro-ecological regions and will help farmers to make informed decisions. The forecast is useful for disaster preparedness and management, agriculture and food security, water and energy and health sectors. Farmers have already begun preparing for the 2019/20 summer cropping season with others having already bought inputs such as seed and fertilisers.
