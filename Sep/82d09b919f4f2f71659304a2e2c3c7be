The Herald NEW YORK. — The immediate aftermath of the US Open tennis final was almost as entertaining as the five-set classic that came before it! In a heartwarming moment, Rafael Nadal, completely overwhelmed after a 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev in four hours and 51 minutes on Sunday, sobbed at the side of the court as his 19 Grand Slam wins were shown on the big screen. A matter of minutes later, a section of the notoriously venomous US Open crowd were up to their old tricks as they booed chair umpire Ali Nili — who handed Nadal three time violations in the match — but the Spaniard was quick to applaud him. The scenes were reminiscent of the women’s final a year earlier when boos rained down on the stage — although Carlos Ramos was not given his gift on court after an infamous row with Serena Williams. — AFP.
