The Herald LAS VEGAS. — British heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury was forced to overcome a terrible cut above his eye to defeat Otto Wallin in Las Vegas on Saturday night. Former world heavyweight champion Fury won via unanimous decision at the T-Mobile Arena but needed to dig deep when he was badly bloodied and thrown off his stride in the third round. Remaining unbeaten in a 30th fight keeps him in line for a rematch with WBC champion Deontay Wilder in February — they drew an exciting battle last year but have unsettled business. Fury might have hoped for a showcase performance on Mexican Independence weekend, a traditional time for major fights in Vegas, but was instead required to show the type of toughness that Mexico’s most famous boxers are known for. The Gypsy King had rebranded himself as El Rey de los Gitanos for the past week and walked to the ring to the sounds of a mariachi band, wearing a poncho and a sombrero. His shorts and gloves were red, white and green like the Mexican flag. Suddenly a crisis emerged when Fury suffered a horrific cut above his right eye after a seemingly innocuous coming-together in the third round.  — Sky Sports.
