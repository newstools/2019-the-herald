The Herald MANCHESTER. — Steve Smith said it “feels amazing” to retain the Ashes after Australia finally ended a stubborn rearguard effort from England on Sunday to win the fourth Test cricket by 185 runs. England, set a huge second-innings target of 383 to win, were bowled out for 197 following some spirited lower-order defiance, putting Australia 2-1 up in the five-Test series ahead of next week’s finale at the Oval. “It feels amazing to know the urn is coming home,” former captain Smith told Sky Sports. Smith has scored an astonishing 671 runs at an average innings of 134.2, including three hundreds, despite missing England’s one-wicket win in the third Test at Headingley with concussion. “I’ve been here a few times when things haven’t gone our way,” he added. “This was always one to tick off my bucket list. It’s extremely satisfying. — AFP.
