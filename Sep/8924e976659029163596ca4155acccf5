The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ALL is set for the second edition of a fundraising match featuring former footballers against inmates at Gwanzura on Saturday. The initiative by the former players, who are now called the Ambassadors, and the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services, is aimed to raise funds for the  upcoming Prisons Day which is commemorated on October 5 every year. The former national team players behind the fund-raising initiative include Justice Majabvi, Dickson Choto, Tinashe Nengomasha, David Sengu and Devine Sena. They visited Harare Central Prison yesterday where they interacted with inmates. “We are very grateful to be partnering ZPCS,’’ said Choto. “We believe it’s for a good cause as we all have relatives who were once incarcerated and there is need to support the inmates as they undergo their rehabilitation. “We call on all Zimbabweans to come in their numbers and support us. “We expect a tough encounter against the inmates who managed to hold us to a three-all draw last year. “This year we will not take them lightly.’’ Inmates team captain Samson Shumbayaremba, who is left with 11 months of his initial eight-year sentence, said they will put up their best show. “We have been preparing for a while for this match and we are going to give the former players a good run. “There is more to play for considering that we will have had a practice session at Yadah Complex before the main match at Gwanzura,” said Shumbayaremba.
