Gospel songbird Pastor Olinda Marowa has penned an emotional song in memory of her late husband, Michael Ziwenga. The song is one of the seven tracks on her fifth album “Yahweh” that was launched on Friday last week at 7 Arts Theatre in Avondale, Harare. Multi-award-winning South African gospel singer Deborah Fraser, Mathias Mhere, Kudzi Nyakudya, Bethan Pasinawako, Rumbidzai Zvirikuzhe and Gospel Joe graced the launch. Marowa and Fraser mesmerised fans with tracks laden with messages of love, peace, unity and restoration. She dedicated the track “Jesus Wipes Tears” to her late husband, who died in 2017. Ziwenga died soon after the couple had founded a church in Gweru. In an interview with The Herald, the songstress said music consoled her after her husband’s passing away. “Dealing with the loss of my husband was not easy but I never stopped doing music. It helped me heal and I returned to music the same year that he died. “Last year, I even travelled to the United Kingdom for a tour, so I never stopped. I had my fans, family and God for support.” She added: “Music soothes the soul. There is a message you can get from music. I have always loved music so much to the extent that I listen to it all the time before I go to bed.” Marowa described working with Fraser in the studio as an amazing experience. “I really treasure the moments I worked with Mama Deborah in the studio. The commitment, hard work and love she showed me touched my heart. I was privileged to have her as my backing vocalist, with producer Bheki Nqoko of Kuwe Records being part of the collaboration,” she said. Marowa’s song “Chenesai Nzira” wowed the crowd and has potential to be a hit. Marowa captivated the crowd with her flawless act and brought the house down with the song “Abanye Bayombona”.
