The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter HARARE City coach Lloyd Chitembwe is not desperate to preserve the municipal club’s impressive record in the Chibuku Super Cup. He says his priority is saving the team from relegation. Chitembwe’s charges take on CAPS United for the second time in less than two weeks in the first round of the country’s premium knockout football tournament at the National Sports Stadium today. Harare City are the most successful team in the history of the tournament. “Honestly speaking, I would prefer to see this team (Harare City) survive relegation than win the Chibuku Super Cup,’’ said Chitembwe. “I think, given a choice, surviving is priority number one.’’ The gaffer, however, said his charges will still try to win the match. “It’s an important assignment and one good thing about it is that some of my players, who didn’t play in the league match which we lost, are now available.” Harare City will welcome back midfielder Moses Muchenje, who was suspended for that league match, while captain Marshal Machazane was on compassionate leave. “We simply didn’t have the spine in that Premiership match which we lost to CAPS United. “But, now that some of the players are back, I think we will have the spine. “Marshal and Moses are now back, I think we will do well. “This is obviously a very different match and we are looking forward to this game. “They have some very good players, but we know our strengths.’’ This duel was supposed to be played on the same day, at the same venue, with the other encounter featuring Black Rhinos and TelOne. But the Rhinos tie has been moved to tomorrow at the same facility.
