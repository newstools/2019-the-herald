BRIAN Chamboko and Ashley Dhlamini will be expected to once again lead from the front when the Zimbabwe Table Tennis team take on their Chinese counterparts this weekend. The two teams will battle it out in the Chinese Ambassador’s Cup China-Zimbabwe table tennis tournament at Harare International School this morning. Chamboko will be the top seed in the men’s category, while Dhlamini will lead the ladies squad.
The top-ranked Zimbabwean players will play their Chinese counterparts in this year’s edition of the annual tournament, which was introduced in 2017 as part of the Zimbabwe/China exchange programmes and sports development. The tournament will feature Zimbabwe and Chinese men and women’s teams, as well as singles matches, with preliminaries being held today and the finals on tomorrow. Nelson Madzokere, the Zimbabwe Table Tennis Union national technical director, said they were ready for the contest and were looking forward to end their opponents’ dominance. “We have prepared well for this event and I am satisfied with the level of optimism within the squad.
“We have an exciting crop of young players that are coming up and, hopefully, we will be able to hold our own.
“It will be a tough competition, but I am positive that with the preparations that we have put in place, we will prevail” said Madzokere.
