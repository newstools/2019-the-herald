That was the first rate cut in more than a year, Kganyago noted that while growth rebounded in the second quarter of the GDP rebounded, economic activity remains weak. He says longer-term weakness in most sectors remain a serious concern, and expected “muted” third-quarter growth as business confidence declined further.
