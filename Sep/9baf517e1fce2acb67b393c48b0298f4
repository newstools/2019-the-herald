The Herald United Nations secretary-general Mr Antonio Guterres has slammed powerful countries that make far-reaching decisions outside the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). He said such decisions were not helpful as they have the potential of fuelling conflict among countries, thereby disturbing the enjoyment of peace. Mr Guterres said this while addressing the 74th United Nations General Assembly in New York. His remarks appeared directed at the US which has imposed illegal sanctions on a number of countries, including Zimbabwe, outside the UN framework. The US and the EU imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe despite a rejection to have them effected through the UN Security Council after Russia and China vetoed the move. He implored leaders to lead by example, saying there were lots of expectations from those they are leading. —  Zvamaida Murwira, New York.
