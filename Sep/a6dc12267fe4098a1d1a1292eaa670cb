Highlanders ……………….0 Mushowani Stars ………… 0 HIGHLANDERS are now set to look for a new coach after Mandla Mpofu failed to reach the target set by the executive to get, at least, six points in three games. Yesterday’s draw at Barbourfields meant he can, at best, get only four points. Mpofu, who replaced Madinda Ndlovu, was handed an ultimatum to get, at least, six points in three matches. He lost the first one against Triangle at Gibbo during midweek. “After careful analysis of recent performances and results, and taking into cognisance the obviously unfavourable position that the team occupies on the log, as club leaders, we have set requirements for positive results from the technical team,’’ club boss Kenneth Mhlope said in a statement last week. “The results will be assessed by the executive after three matches, the first one being . . . against Triangle FC which we, unfortunately, lost 1-2. “In these three matches, the coaches are expected to collect a minimum of six points. “Whereas effort is being made to bring positive results, I kindly ask every Highlanders FC stakeholder to remain calm, positive and supportive.’’ Bosso are win-less in their last four league matches and remain deep in relegation trouble.
