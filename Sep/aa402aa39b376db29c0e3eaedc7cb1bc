AUSTRALIA-BASED Bernard Muchemwa has joined the league of Zimbabweans based outside the country making efforts to contribute to local football. Muchemwa is headingÂ  a football revolution in Sydney, Australia, with his Zimbabwe Warriors in Australia, a group of young Zimbabweans residing in that country. This is an ambitious project to produce the next generation of good footballers and candidates for junior and senior national teams back home. The programme focuses on young players from the age of five to 21. While most of them are attached to good clubs in Australia, he feels they are rough diamonds who need polishing. His passion is to help the players develop individually, technically and mentally. Some of the boys are eyeing overseas markets and this goes a long way to help them achieve their dreams.
