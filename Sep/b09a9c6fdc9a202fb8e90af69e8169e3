The Herald Arcadia lithium developer, Prospect Resources Ltd which is already listed on the Australian Securities Exchange last Friday announced that it was listing its shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. In a statement, the company said the Frankfurt listing expands its investor reach and increases the Company’s exposure to European markets, which is one of the largest regions consuming ultra-low iron petalite in the glass and ceramics market. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the world’s third largest exchange-trading market, behind the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. More than 50 percent of the total trades on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange are conducted through investors in countries outside of Germany. Prospect’s managing director, Sam Hosack, said “Prospect now has access to new clients and capital markets and will gain greater liquidity and exposure to many more retail and institutional investors. “This also places us in the European region that is home to some of the largest glass and ceramic end user customers.”
