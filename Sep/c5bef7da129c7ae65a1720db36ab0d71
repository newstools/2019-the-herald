The Herald BURNLEY. — Jurgen Klopp admitted he has been surprised by Liverpool’s 100 percent start to the English Premier League football season after a 3-0 victory at Burnley on Saturday kept his side two points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table. The European champions struggled in pre-season, losing three times, as they had to cope largely without Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane after their participation in international tournaments during the summer. But all three have picked up where they left off last season as Klopp’s men extended their winning run in the Premier League to a club record 13 games. “If you ask me four weeks ago I wouldn’t expect it would happen,” said Klopp. “We had a tricky pre-season. No pre-season for the front three but they still deliver. So far, so good.” Burnley were left to rue missing the first big chance of the match when Chris Wood got in behind the Liverpool defence just three minutes in and turned Virgil van Dijk, but the New Zealander’s shot was just too close to Adrian, who palmed the ball to safety. Liverpool went straight down the other end and were inches away from an early lead themselves when Salah’s fiercely struck effort came back off the post. — AFP.
