According to summons filed at the High Court, the minister, who is the applicant, through Harare Polytechnic College, opened bank accounts with Metbank namely Funds for Tertiary, Amenities and Zimber Students Account. The business agreement was that the money will be withdrawn whenever the need arose and a total of US$1 597 662,68 was deposited in the bank. “In 2013, the bank started to show signs of failing to release money deposited by the college,” reads the summons.
