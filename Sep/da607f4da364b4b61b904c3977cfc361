The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter GLOW Petroleum coach Perpetua Siyachitema says their campaign in the Rainbow Amateur Netball League this season has not been one of their best. They are battling to find the touch that saw them finishing second last year. The Kwekwe-based team are currently seventh on the table with 29 points from 21 matches.  They have won 14 matches, lost six and drawn one. “I can say this year Glow hasn’t been playing well. I am not really sure if it was because of my absence. “I think I motivate the players, my presence has great impact on the team. When I wasn’t around, there were a lot of defeats even to teams I didn’t expect to beat us. “Maybe my absence also contributed because before I went to the World Cup I managed to attend just one game against ZDF.  “The other problem is I don’t have many players, those that are available are injured. My other two shooters are injured, so I only have two that are playing currently,’’ said Siyachitema. She said it’s unfortunate she could not adequately beef up her team during the transfer window. “We have also a 17-year-old Thandekile Mahlangu, a mid-court player. She is from Bulawayo. It’s unfortunate I could not get players during the transfer window. “I am just trying to maintain what’s there. I am trying to introduce young players. We also have 18-year-old Margret Mpofu, who is a defender.  “I am going to use a new strategy, looking for young and energetic players.’’ Glow Petroleum are likely to take on Tenax this weekend. In a match played yesterday, Ngezi Platinum continued with their winning streak when they beat Black Rhinos lost 49-46 in a closely-contested battle.
