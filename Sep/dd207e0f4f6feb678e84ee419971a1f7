The Herald Yesterday’s jump in international fuel prices might only have an impact on local prices in the next three or five weeks, according to Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority acting chief executive officer Edington Mazambani. “Zimbabwe generally receives its fuel deliveries from the high seas between three to five weeks. ZERA will continue to monitor the oil prices and supplies trend in light of the development in the Middle East and will advise consumers and stakeholders accordingly. Notwithstanding the above, consumers are urged to use fuel products efficiently for both productive and personal use,” said Mr Mazambani.
