The Herald ROME. –  Cristiano Ronaldo returns to Italian football league action after his four-goal spree for Portugal as Juventus head for Fiorentina today also boosted by coach Maurizio Sarri’s highly-anticipated debut on the bench after a bout of pneumonia. The ex-Chelsea coach missed his first two league games with the Serie A champions against Parma and his former club Napoli. But the 60-year-old will be on the bench for the first time today as Juventus look to make it three wins this season before their Champions League opener at Atletico Madrid midweek. Ronaldo’s four goals in Portugal’s European qualifying win over Lithuania during the week were enough to send shivers down the spines of Fiorentina fans. The 34-year-old overtook Ireland’s Robbie Keane as the all-time top scorer in Euro qualifiers, with 25 goals, and will be looking to impress further with the winner of the Best Fifa Football Awards to be named in Milan on September 23. Ronaldo will lead the Juventus attack along with Douglas Costa and Gonzalo Higuain, the Argentine also in-form on his return to Turin after a loan spell at Chelsea.
