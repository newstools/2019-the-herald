The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter SOUTH Africa-based Body Works Gym hulk Ndumiso Dlodlo appears the man to beat in the battle for the Mr Zimbabwe title at the 7Arts Theatre in Harare this evening. Dlodlo comes into the 2019 competition on the back of winning two titles in a row in previous editions. He also won the PPC Mr ZITF title earlier this year. The hulk will be lining up against virtually the same opponents he has been facing, but it’s likely his biggest challenge will come from Nunurai Masosonere. Masosonere won the recent Marume Classic and Manicaland Classic. However, Dlodlo did not take part in the two events. Of interest also is that when Dlodlo won the last two Mr Zimbabwe editions, Masosonere had taken a sabbatical. He was establishing his own Family Fitness Gym. And this now sets up an interesting duel between the country’s premier muscle men. A win for Dlodlo will see him going into the history books which have the likes of George Takundwa (four-time champion), Givemore Marume (five-time champion), Champion Chiendweramwano (four-time champion) and Innocent Choga, who won the title back-to-back. Also to lookout for is the reigning Pretoria Classic champion, Eliah Samaringa, who trains at Total Fitness Gym at Longchen. “I have been working hard in the gym. I am very confident that I am going to do well in this contest,’’ said Samaringa. “I have been motivated by my win in South Africa. “Winning my division at a competitive contest was a plus for me.’’ This year the event is sponsored by Zimpapers, Mokuba, Royal Flair Events, Kopje Spares, Senchem, Guard Alert and Crystal Candy. A number of companies have also come on board to partner the National Federation of Zimbabwe Body Building Fitness                           to help make this year’s edition one of the most glamorous events in the sport’s history. The event’s registration has already started and it will end this morning.
