Event sponsor Africabet poured in $500 000 as the sponsorship package. Over 100 participants, drawn from all over the world, are taking part. The seminar is billed to run until Friday. “I am so happy to be part of this event and I believe it is going to be a great success,’’ said Iwado. “We have always supported sport and we are not limited to karate only as we are actively involved in judo and wheelchair tennis, among other disciplines. “We will continue to support sports activities in the country and, for karate, it is one of the best way for self-defence.’’ Top international instructors, including 10th Dan Japanese instructor Tetsuhiro Hokama, 9th Dan Hanshi Ron Nix and the local sensei Eli Stamnes, are in the country for the next five days. They will conduct the training and grading of participants. Karatekas from the United States, Zambia, Norway, Scotland, Japan, Greece, Sweden and South Africa flocked into the country from Friday to take part in the six–day convention. Zimbabwe Karate Union president, Paul Danisa, said they were honoured to host an event of such magnitude. “We are excited to be part of bringing and hosting the world-class instructors in the country. “Despite the economic challenges in our country, we are happy that we have managed to bring some of the best instructors in the country,’’ said Danisa.
