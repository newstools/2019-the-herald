foreign-based Zimbabwean karatekas — Colin Ndlovu and Tendayi Magorimbo — have accepted an invitation to take part in the €50 000 International Turkish Open Karate tournament to be held in Istanbul from September 27 to 29. The three-day tournament is expected to attract top karatekas from across the globe who will be fighting at this Grand Prix event. According to Muzondiwa Gilbert Makowah of the Zimbabwe Shaolin Wushu School, Ndlovu, who is based in Canada, and UK-based Magorimbo accepted the invitation to represent Zimbabwe at the Turkish Open tournament after the locally-based karatekas from his school failed to raise the airfares to the European country. “Our Zimbabwe Shaolin Wushu School has been invited to take part in the Turkish Open Karate tournament to be held in Istanbul this September. “Unfortunately we have had no local takers for this event as most of our local refined athletes cannot raise the airfares to the tournament. Accommodation and local transportation had been waivered by the Organising Committee whilst we meet our own travelling expenses. “In view of the foregoing, our foreign-based athletes of Colin Ndlovu (Canada) and Tendayi Magorimbo (UK) have confirmed that they will participate as they have their eyes on the prize money. “We are now concentrating on the Botswana Open Martial Arts tournament to be held in October,” Makowah told The Herald yesterday. The International Turkish Open Karate tournament is one of the richest martial arts tournaments in the world in terms of cash prizes for the winners of the different weight categories at this event. Esat Delihasan, the president of Turkish Karate Federation, said they are ready to host a new event — the International Turkish Open Karate tournament — “with €50 000 cash award which will be delivered to the athletes in places and general classification reward will also be delivered to the clubs”.  All World Karate Federation affiliated Federations/Clubs and athletes may participate in this international event and cash prizes will be handed to all medallists in individual categories, Delihasan added.
