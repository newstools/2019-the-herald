Gen-Col Sheiman who landed at the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport yesterday morning for a three-day business tour sent condolences to the Mugabe family. “I would like to pass my condolences to the Mugabe family following the death of former President Robert Mugabe. “I would like to convey condolences to President Mnangagwa and all the people of Zimbabwe. “He was a great hero of the Republic of Zimbabwe and he contributed a great deal in the liberation and development of Zimbabwe. “The President of Belarus has since sent condolences to President Mnangagwa, but I feel I should do the same.
