The Herald SYDNEY. — Ricky Ponting, Australia’s cricket greatest run-scorer, hailed Steve Smith as “a genius” today after his Ashes double hundred — an exploit his country’s media said was “Donald Bradman-like”. Smith has taken his game to a new level since returning from a 12-month ball-tampering ban this year, with his 211 in the fourth Test at Old Trafford giving him an incredible batting average during the series of 147.25. “You hear all sorts of words, ‘genius’ is one that comes to mind,” Ponting told cricket.com.au when asked to sum up Smith’s knock, which put Australia in a dominant position after two days. “A remarkable innings again. It’s his application to what he does. He just doesn’t make any mistakes. His concentration levels are obviously unbelievably good.” Even Ponting, one of cricket’s sharpest minds, struggled to think of how to get him out. But he did have some advice. “He’s only been out nine times lbw in his last 99 innings, so you know if you’re bowling straight you’re not going to get him out,” he said.  “The one thing you have to do is try and challenge the outside of his bat. He doesn’t miss it on the inside.” Smith, who last week regained first place in the ICC Test batting rankings ahead of India’s Virat Kohli, is increasingly being compared to legendary countryman Bradman, widely considered Test cricket’s best ever. — AFP.
