ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League leaders Cranbone Bullets coach, Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera, believes their clash against Black Mambas will play a huge role in deciding the championship race. The two sides battle at Morris Depot this afternoon in a re-arranged fixture with the army side having a 15-point lead. Saruchera’s men thrashed Harare City Cubs 4-0 at the weekend while Mambas were held to another draw by Karoi United.
