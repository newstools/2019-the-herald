The Herald Tobias Mandoreba in HWANGE Hwange . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 Highlanders . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 A DRAW was probably the fairest result in this balanced Castle Lager Premier League match before a huge crowd at the Colliery yesterday. Highlanders got the first opportunity with a dipping Brian Banda effort finding an alert Taimon Mvula in goals for Hwange in the 12th minute. The hosts threw a punch back and came close to breaking the deadlock hardly two minutes later through Lucky Vundla, but his glancing header crashed over the bar. It became a see-saw affair with Highlanders dominating possession in the final stages of the half. They bombarded the Hwange goal area through some inspired performances by Nqobizitha Masuku, Ray Lunga and Devine Mhindirira. But the goalkeeper kept denying them. Mvula was also on guard to stop efforts from Prince Dube and Mbongeni Ndlovu in the final minutes of the half. Hwange lacked fire-power upfront with their usually reliable striker, Kasimero Chimbadzwa, off form. The big chance of the day fell to Bosso striker Tinashe Makanda in time added on when he came face-to-face with Mvula after a swift attack but he shot tamely into the hands of the goalkeeper. The last moments were characterised by some drama as the Hwange technical bench felt hard done by referee Prince Matumo, whom they accused of ignoring an incident in which goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda appeared to kick substitute Loyd Mutoma off the ball inside the box. “The boys put up a decent performance although we have to work on a number of areas but the officiating we witnessed was not pleasing,’’ said Hwange coach, Nation                                    Dube. Bosso gaffer, Mandla “Lulu” Mpofu, bemoaned the chances his charges wasted. “We created chances but we wasted them and in football dominance doesn’t give you three points. “A point on the road is not bad though,’’ he said.
