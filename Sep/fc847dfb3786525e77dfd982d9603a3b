ZIMBABWE boxing star Charles Manyuchi has managed to save the World Boxing Federation middleweight bout against Argentine Diago Gallardo after he beat the two-hour deadline he was given to shed off extra weight. This means the much-anticipated fight will take place as scheduled this Saturday night at the Harare International Conference Centre. Manyuchi encountered a brief setback at the weigh-in when he returned 200g above the stipulated weight in the fight category. Manyuchi weighed-over 72.9 kilograms against the middleweight limit of 72.575 kilos and was given two hours to correct the anomaly. With Gallardo, who was in-weight at 71.2kg relaxing, Manyuchi had to undergo a gruelling mass-shedding activities as officials from the WBF waited for the outcome. The Chivhu-based fighter eventually shed off to clock 72.4 kilos, much to the relief of his handlers. Had Manyuchi failed to weigh-in within the stipulated period, the fight could have been cancelled or, Gallardo willing, it would have been reduced to a non-title bout. More to followâ€¦
